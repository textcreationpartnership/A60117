            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>NO Collection of Caſes adjudged in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament having been yet publiſhed, a Preface ſeems neceſſary to beſpeak the Reception of that which is now preſented to the World.</p>
            <p>To commend or excuſe the Collector, will not perhaps be a method to introduce it moſt to advantage: what may be ſpoken in favour of his diligence or capacity, will be cenſured vain, and if any excuſe be offered for his ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility to have done it better, ſome will be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to take him at his word, and think the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance comes from a careleſs or unskilful Hand.</p>
            <p>Whatever the Author is, there needs no A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pology to be made for the nature or deſign of the Work it ſelf; for the Subject Matter will be uſeful and entertaining to all Ranks of Engliſh Men, to whom Books are ſo; that is, to all ſuch as underſtand and love Literature.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:50172:3"/>
            <p>Here is our Municipal Law, and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of it, Equity and the Law of Nations in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terſperſed; here is the manner of arguing, and the language of the Bar briefly toucht; here are the Forms of Proceedings ſometimes mentioned, but then again thoſe Forms are ſuperſeded by the Original and Eternal Rules of Juſtice.</p>
            <p>By the Debates and Arguments here repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, you may be acquainted in ſome meaſure with the Rights of the Peers, and their inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity to alien ſuch their Rights; with the nature of Slander, and ſome Rules concerning it; the Courſe of Equity in reſpect of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties and Coſts.</p>

            <p>The nature of Colledges, Hoſpitals, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Elemoſynary Foundations, and the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and Power of Viſitors, and the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of their Proceedings; the Court of

            <p>The Preference of an Outlawry upon meſne Proceſs to a Judgment not extended, and the practiſe and reaſon of the practiſe of the Court of Exchequer in that caſe; the Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration which a Court of Equity ought to have of Bonds, Bills, or Promiſes made or gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven upon Condition or Conſideration of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting and procuring Matches.</p>
            <p>The dependency which Ireland hath upon <hi>England,</hi> and her ſubordination to it, and the Authority of the Houſe of Peers in This, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Proceedings in the Chancery of That Kingdom; the opinion of Equity upon Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional Limitations, and what will be a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of ſuch Conditions, and to whom the Profits ſhall go during the intermediate time, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            <p>The nature of the Office of a Clerk of the Peace, and by whom grantable, and for what Intereſt, and how removeable; the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative of Preſenting to Benefices made void by Promotion, and if ſuch Prerogative be ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved or fulfilled by a Commendam; and
<pb facs="tcp:50172:4"/>whether it can operate upon a new created Pariſh or Rectory; the formal reaſon and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Treaſon, and wherein it conſiſts, and what is neceſſary to be alledged in Indictments for that Offence; the right of Tythes for Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bage or Agiſtment of Cattle grazed and fed for Sale, tho' formerly uſed to the Plough.</p>
            <p>The Expoſition of a Will of a Native of <hi>France,</hi> and by what meaſures a Judgment ought to be made of the meaning of Phraſes uſed by ſuch Perſons, in that Language, upon ſuch an occaſion; the Conſtruction of the word <hi>Share</hi> in a Will, concerning the New-River Water; the force or validity of a Grant or Aſſignment of Land (in which the Grantor had a very long term) to hold from and after the Grantor's deceaſe; the Title of Knight, if, and how, part of the Name, and what Allegations in a Count in a <hi>Quare Impedit</hi> are not needful to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered to, and what may be traverſed, and what Grants of the Crown ſhall be good notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding ſome, and what Miſrecitals.</p>
            <p>Theſe and many other Particulars, worthy of moſt Mens notice, are here debated; and it may reaſonably be ſuppoſed, that none will be Enemies to the Deſign and Publication, but thoſe who miſlike the ſmall Remainders, we have left us, of the Ariſtocratical part of our Government: the Gentlemen who do ſo, muſt be unacquainted with the Grecian and Roman Story, as well as with our own, or elſe have read it but ſuperficially; for even the
<pb facs="tcp:50172:5"/>moſt perfect of the <hi>Grecian</hi> Common-wealths were ſomewhat Ariſtocratical. That which may be called ſuch, is <hi>Sparta,</hi> which, tho' it had ſome Laws we cannot account for, yet during ſeveral Centuries it maintained its own Liberty, and aſſiſted its Neighbours to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve theirs.</p>
            <p>And notwithſtanding ſome Men may think the contrary, Democracy was not the only Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite Model of the Ancient Legiſlators. The wiſe <hi>Solon,</hi> who founded that Popular Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of <hi>Athens,</hi> was not ſo fond of his own Frame, as to recommend it to other places, tho' he believed that it ſuited beſt with the Infirmities of the People: And even in <hi>Rome,</hi> before ſhe acquired any great Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, there was a Senate, under Kings it had one, nor doth it appear that a Senate was adjudged uſeleſs, when it became and was called a Common-wealth. And as ſoon as the Senate loſt its Authority, a Tyranny was ſet up: This may be called their Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cratical Part; and whoſoever reads the Lives of thoſe <hi>Roman</hi> Worthies, <hi>Cato <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ticenſis,</hi> &amp;c. that nobly attempted to defend the Liberties of their Country, will find, That it was for the upholding the Authority of the Senate, that they conteſted, fought, and died.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Machiavel</hi> indeed, in his Diſcourſes upon the Decades of <hi>Titus Livius,</hi> has ſtrained al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt every thing in favour of Democracy, and with extream Art and Labour, hath il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrated
<pb facs="tcp:50172:5"/>a Popular State, and made <hi>Rome</hi> the Example of it; and yet even in thoſe Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, he ſometimes ſhews the Neceſſity of an Ariſtocratical Mixture, to make a juſt and regular, and happy and laſting Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>Nay, <hi>Algernoon Sydney</hi> himſelf, that famous Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertor of Liberty, doth almoſt every where prefer the Ariſtocracy; and he was confirmed in that Sentiment, by the Views he had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of former and preſent Governments, and by the Knowledge he had of what formerly was our own Conſtitution, till <hi>Henry</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venths Reign: For that Prince (as the Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> rightly obſerves) was rather cunning in relation to his own Times, then a Perſon that had a full proſpect of what would afterwards be the Conſequence of his Meaſures, or that had a due regard to Poſterity: No Man can wiſh, that the Houſe of Lords ſhould be made Cyphers; if they could once again be made the Natural Balance between the King and People.</p>
            <p>There drop, even from Mr. <hi>Sidney</hi>'s Pen, Expreſſions enough to prove, that a juſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the Three Powers, Monarchical, Ariſtocratical, and Democratical, would have been reckoned even by him an equal Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>
            <p>Such a Mixture even our Government was; and tho' ſome, perhaps out of meer Ignorance, have diſputed the Democratical,
<pb facs="tcp:50172:6"/>and others the Monarchical part of our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution; yet no Body ever to this day could pretend, that our Barons, thoſe <hi>Majores Reg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni,</hi> had not originally a Share both in the Legiſlature and Adminiſtration within this Kingdom: The Fact is not neceſſary to be proved, becauſe 'tis not denied; and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonableneſs of it is apparent.</p>
            <p>There's no occaſion to Complement them for what their Anceſtors did in procuring of <hi>Magna Charta</hi> (which the judicious and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defatigable Antiquary Sir <hi>Henry Spelman,</hi> ſaith, was only an Aſcertainment or Recompile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our Old Laws).</p>
            <p>It would be of Publick Service, to have a juſt State of the true Powers of the Houſe of Lords in their Judicial and Legiſlative Capacities, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the true <hi>Engliſh</hi> Conſtitution; that we might be familiarized to the almoſt anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quated Notions of the Ariſtocratical part of our Government; and ſo may neither be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>run with the Schemes of Abſolute Monarchy-Men, who would have all Judicial Power, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the Dernier Reſort lodged in the Crown, or in Delegates appointed by it, and not in the Parliament, nor be crumbled into the Diſorders which muſt follow the Notions of thoſe who aim at a pure Democracy.</p>
            <p>But to write an Exact Diſcourſe upon this Head, would require more Lines then can become a Preface: The Reader therefore muſt not here expect an Account of the

               <hi>Dominus Rex,</hi> &amp; Viſcount <hi>Purbeck.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>UPON a Petition, the Queſtion was in the Houſe of Lords, Whether the Dignity of a Viſcount could be ſurrendred to the King by a Fine? And it was Argued at the Bar by three Counſel for the Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner, and by the Attorney General for the King. It was urged on behalf of the Petitioner, That a Dignity cannot be ſurrendred to the Crown; and that for theſe Reaſons:</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is a Perſonal Dignity annexed to the Blood, and ſo inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable and immoveable, (See <hi>Ratcliff</hi>'s Caſe 3 Rep. <hi>Rutland</hi>'s Caſe 6 Rep. 53.) that it cannot be either transferred to any other Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, or ſurrendred to the Crown; it can neither move forward nor backward, but only downward to Poſterity; and nothing but a Deficiency or a Corruption of the Blood can hinder the Deſcent, as if the Anceſtor be Attainted of Treaſon or Felony, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For in that Caſe, the Heir conveying no Inheritable Blood, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not make any Claim to that which is annexed to the Inheritable Blood; and beſides, there is a tacite Condition of Forfeiture an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to thoſe Dignities, by the Breach of which Condition the Dignity is determined; but by the Act of the Party there can be no Determination of it, unleſs there be an Attainder which cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupts the Blood: And he took a difference between Ancient Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours and Dignities which were Feodary and Officiary (as Earl Marſhal of <hi>England</hi>) which have a Relation to an Office or Land, for ſuch are Transferrable over; and ſuch Dignities as are only Perſonal, Inherent in the Blood, and only favour <hi>quaſi</hi> of the Reality, of which no Fine can be levied, as 'tis of an Annuity to a Man and his Heirs, no Fine can be levied.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A Dignity was neither ſubject to a Condition at the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law, nor intailable by the Statute <hi>de Donis, &amp;c.</hi> nor barra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by the Statute of Fines: Indeed, in <hi>Nevil</hi>'s Caſe, ſomething which favours of the contrary Opinion is ſaid; but the Queſtion there was, Whether 'twas forfeitable by Treaſon? And therefore the preſent Queſtion is very forreign to the Matter there debated.
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:50172:8"/>A Dignity differs from other Inheritances, being an Honour Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal affixed to the Blood, cannot be forfeited by a Non-per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of a Condition, except that Tacite Condition in Law, and conſequently cannot be intailed; and tho' the Title of a Viſcount be of a Place, yet it is only Titular, for it is often taken from the Sirnames of Families.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Title of Viſcount, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is not ſo much a private Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt as a publick Right, for Peers are born Counſellors of State, and one part of a Senatory Body, and therefore cannot be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced without the Conſent of all thoſe who have intereſt in it; they cannot, without the Conſent of the whole Body, whereof they are ſo conſiderable Members, cut themſelves off from the Body; and ſo the Objection of <hi>quilibet poteſt Juri ſuo renuntiare</hi> is eaſily anſwered.</p>
            <p>'Twas further argued on the ſame ſide, That</p>
            <p n="1">1. An Honour goes not according to the Rules of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law, nor is it governable by them, it is not therefore perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent to argue from thoſe Rules which hold in Caſes of other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritances, for a Dignity deſcends to the Half-blood, there is no Coparcinerſhip of it, but the Eldeſt takes the whole; a Fee-ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple will go to a Noble-man without the word <hi>(Heirs)</hi> 1 <hi>Inſt.</hi> 27. It differs from Eſtates in Land in the Intrinſick Matter, as well as the Manner of the Limitation, becauſe it is given for two Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, for Counſel and Defence; and it is a Civil Intereſt, appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Civil Conſtitution of the Realm, which goes with the Blood, and is inherent in the Blood, inſomuch that it is agreed on all hands, that it can't be transferred to a Stranger; and till <hi>Nevil</hi>'s Caſe, 'twas doubted whether forfeitable for Treaſon; if a Lord die, his Son ſhall be introduc'd without the Ceremony uſual at the firſt Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation; a Peer's eldeſt Son, and all Minors, ſit behind the Chair of State, to prepare them for the Sitting in the Houſe as Members, and becauſe they have ſome Title to the Honour they are called <hi>Nobiles Nati,</hi> for the firſt time they fetch breath they have No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility in them: So that he that Surrenders by Fine, muſt not only extinguiſh his Eſtate in the Honour, but alſo the Nobility of his Blood.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Every Lord is not only a Lord for himſelf, but alſo hath a Right of Peerage, and is a Peer of the Realm, and therefore a Peer for every one of the Houſe, and therefore hath the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to demand his Writ <hi>Ex debito Juſtitiae,</hi> and is to be tried by his Peers in Capital Crimes; and that appears farther from a Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which happened in this Houſe, 16 <hi>Car.</hi> 2. There was an Order mentioning the Biſhops to be Lords of Parliament, not Peers; at which the Lords wondering, ordered a Committee to examine the reaſon of it; which proves that <hi>Lord</hi> is not ſo high nor inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive as <hi>Peers:</hi> So that if the Fine have any Operation, it takes
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:50172:8"/>away not only his Right, but alſo the Right of the Houſe of Lords.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The trial of Baron or no Baron upon Iſſue in any Court of Judicature is by the Records of Parliament; but if a Fine may be levied in the <hi>Common Pleas,</hi> the Trial is drawn <hi>ad aliud Examen,</hi> and muſt then be by the Records of that Court. The Clerk of the Parliament always certifies if he be a Baron, becauſe he hath the Record before him; but he cannot certifie he is no Baron, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he hath not the Record thereof before him.</p>
            <p n="4">4. No Fine can be levied of a thing Perſonal, as an Annuity to a Man and his (Heirs), but a Dignity is a thing Perſonal; and ſo he took notice of the difference betwixt the Honours of Peerage, which are Perſonal, and the Honours that are Feodary and Officia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, which have reference to an Office or Land.</p>
            <p n="5">5. He did argue <hi>ab inconvenienti</hi> that this Opinion can be no Inconveniency to the Crown; but the contrary makes Nobility a meer Pageantry, by putting it into the Hands of a weak and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry Father, to diſpoſſeſs an hopeful Son of that which is his Birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right: The Titles of <hi>Eſquire</hi> and <hi>Gentleman</hi> are drowned in the greater Dignity of that of a <hi>Peer,</hi> and when the greater are gone, the other muſt go with it: And then from being a <hi>Nobleman</hi> to day, he and the reſt of his Family muſt be below all Nobility, and be called <hi>Yeomen</hi> or <hi>Goodman Villers</hi> to morrow, which may bring great Confuſion to a Noble Family and all its Relatives; and ſurely this Houſe will not put ſuch a publick Diſreſpect on ſuch a Family, by agreeing to ſo unjuſt an act of one Man. And that which was moſt relied upon, was a Reſolution of this Houſe in <hi>Stafford</hi>'s Caſe, <hi>Anno</hi> 1640. which no Man without Indecency can queſtion; it paſſed not <hi>ſub ſilentio</hi> or <hi>obiter,</hi> but upon debate; neither could it be any way invalid upon account of the Times, for it was in the Infancy of that Parliament, and that wherein a Peer's Caſe, who ſits now in this Houſe, was judicially before them; and therefore there is no reaſon to ſhake that Judgment more than any other Judgment of that time. My Lord <hi>Cooke</hi> in his 4 <hi>Inſt. Chapt.</hi> of <hi>Ireland,</hi> is of Opinion that Honours cannot be extinguiſhed but by Act of Parliament. Then as to the Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents that have been urg'd on the other ſide, there are none di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly to the Point; for as to <hi>Nevil</hi>'s Caſe, there are very few Caſes cited there aright, and are not to be look'd upon as Law. The Caſe of my Lord of <hi>Northumberland</hi> in 3 <hi>&amp;</hi> 4 <hi>Phil. &amp; Mar.</hi> was by way of Creation, and ſo was the Caſe of <hi>Dudley.</hi> And <hi>Dugdale</hi> in his Baronage of <hi>England, pag.</hi> 270. gives an account of it; and the reſt of the Precedents are above Two hundred years old, which paſſed <hi>ſub ſilentio,</hi> and are not to be vouched un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they were diſputed. The firſt is <hi>Bigod</hi>'s, who in the time of <hi>Edw.</hi> 1. ſurrendred the Honour of Earl-Marſhal of <hi>England</hi> to the King, who granted it to him in Tail: This Honour is Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiary, and therefore nothing to the purpoſe; and the Surrender
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:50172:9"/>was made thro' fear, <hi>Walſingham</hi> 95. The next is the Earl of <hi>Pembroke</hi>'s Caſe, who in 8 <hi>Edw.</hi> 4. was made <hi>Earl</hi> in Tail, and by this he had the Grant of the Town of <hi>Haverfordue;</hi> the King afterwards inclining to dignifie his Son with that Title, procured him to Surrender by Deed, and beſtowed on him another Title, and gave a greater Eſtate, and an ancienter Honour. Here was an Eſtate Tail ſurrendred by Deed; it might work a kind of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continuance, but no legal effectual Surrender. And for the Caſe of <hi>Ch. Brandon,</hi> who in the time of <hi>H.</hi> 8. was created Viſcount <hi>Liſle,</hi> afterwards he ſurrendred that, and got a Dukedom; now no Man ever queſtioned the efficacy of this Surrender, for he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf had no reaſon to queſtion it, for 'twas to his advantage; and none other could queſtion it, for he died without Iſſue, and his Honour with him: And ſo in the Caſe of my Lord <hi>Stafford,</hi> he ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendred, and got a new Honour. So that it appeared all theſe Caſes were either Honours referring to Offices and Lands, or elſe ſuch as were for the re-granting of greater Dignities, which they had no reaſon to queſtion, and ſo they paſſed <hi>ſub ſilentio:</hi> But here is not one Precedent that they did ever Surrender to the Prejudice of their Blood, or move themſelves quite out of the Houſe by Fine or Deed. And further, If Precedents be good for the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render of an Honour by Fine, why not alſo for Transferring of it to another? for of this we have ſome Precedents, <hi>Daincourt</hi>'s Caſe, 4 <hi>Inſt.</hi> 126. One Branch of the Family ſat in the Houſe by virtue of a Grant from the other Branch from the Reign of <hi>Ed.</hi> 2. to <hi>Hen.</hi> 6. and the Caſe of the Earldom of <hi>Cheſter,</hi> firſt granted 17 <hi>H.</hi> 3. <hi>n.</hi> 25. and transferred 39 <hi>H.</hi> 3. And there was an At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt made in the Lord <hi>Fitzwater</hi>'s Caſe, to make a Baron by transferring of the Dignity; but you will find all theſe Precedents diſallowed: And 'twas ſaid that no Man ever met with any Caſe where any Nobleman by Fine levied, or other Conveyance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a Yeoman or Ignoble.</p>
            <p>'T was argued by another much to the ſame effect, That Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage and Peerage is to be determined by the Records of the Lords Houſe, and if any other way be given, as there muſt be, if a Fine be allow'd to barr, then the old true way is gone: This was not a Fine Conditional at the Common Law, and therefore not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Statute <hi>De donis Conditionalibus,</hi> and an Honour being a Perſonal Dignity, is not to be barred (<hi>Jones Rep.</hi> 123.) by Fine, being inherent in the Blood, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Duke of <hi>Bedford</hi> was by Authority of Parliament degraded, and that was for Poverty, and by Act of Parliament, and not by Surrender: Therefore Judgment was prayed for the Petitioner.</p>
            <p>The Attorney General argued <hi>pro Domino Rege</hi> upon theſe Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons:</p>
            <p n="1">1. There is but a defective Proof of the Creation of this Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, no Letters Patents, no Records of the Inrollment produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, nor any Entry in any Office of ſuch a Patent, as is uſual; all
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:50172:9"/>that is pretended is, That he ſate in ſome Parliaments afterwards as Viſcount <hi>Purbeck;</hi> but that will not be accepted for proof; for no Man can be created <hi>Viſcount</hi> but by Letters Patents: a Writ of Summons will be an Evidence of a Creation, but will not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount to a Creation; there is a Ceremony equal almoſt to that of an Earl, there muſt be a Coronet; all which muſt be perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or he muſt have Letters Patents to diſpenſe with it, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Matter of Record, muſt be produced. 18 <hi>Hen.</hi> 6. <hi>Beaumont</hi> was the firſt created <hi>Viſcount,</hi> but there was never any ſince, nor then without Letters Patents; for he is to take place of ſome, and therefore he muſt have ſomething to ſhow for his Precedency; but a <hi>Baron</hi> is the loweſt Dignity, and therefore may be created by Writ: Neither can it be preſumed that they were loſt, for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it be produced it makes no Title; except they be produced, it ſhall not be intended there was any; neither can it be help'd by any concurrent Evidence, for if there were (<hi>Page</hi>'s Caſe 5 <hi>Rep.</hi> 53.) a true Creation, there would be ſome Evidence in ſome of the Offices; but there is not in any of them the leaſt <hi>veſtigia</hi> of proof to ground a preſumption.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Dignities, as well as other Inheritances, muſt be limited ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Rules of Law; the Dukedom of <hi>Cornwal</hi> (in 8 <hi>Rep.</hi> the 1. the Prince's Caſe) was limited according to the ſtricteſt Rules of Law. And whereas it hath been ſaid that Dignities dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from other Inheritances, that is where there is ſome particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar reaſon for it, as in the caſe of Tranſmiſſion or Alienation, which depends not upon the Manner of Creation, as ſhall be ſhewn afterwards: And for the Caſe of 1 <hi>Inſt.</hi> 27. which was that an Inheritance of a Dignity may be created by other words than other Inheritances are, as an Eſtate Tail without the words <hi>of this body,</hi> there's not any ſuch thing in the Book: 'Tis ſaid in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, that if the King for reward of Services done, do grant <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories</hi> to a Man and his Heirs Males, 'tis an entail of the Coat without ſaying <hi>of his body;</hi> but I think that will not be taken for the Caſe of a Dignity; the Statute <hi>De donis Conditionalibus</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to Honours; the word <hi>terram</hi> would be thought an impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per word to comprehend all things tailable, yet ſaid to extend to all, and to Honours too, 1 <hi>Inſt.</hi> 20. and if an Honour can't be entailed, then no Remainder can be limited; and yet there be many Lords that ſit in this Houſe by Remainder by good Title. The Statute of 26 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8.17. ſaith, That if a Man be Attainted of Treaſon, he ſhall forfeit his Lands, Tenements, and Heredita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: Now 'tis adjudged that the word <hi>Hereditaments</hi> compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends Honours; which ſhow that they are ſubject to the ſame Rules of Law that govern other kind of Inheritances, and are compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended with other Particulars without general words. This be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing premiſed, it's a known Maxim in all Laws, <hi>Nihil rationi ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gis conſentaneum quam rem eodem modo diſſolvi quo conſtituitur,</hi> which Rule is ſo general, that the higheſt Authority, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament is not exempt from it; for 'tis not poſſible to eſtabliſh any thing ſo firm by Statute, which cannot by another Statute be
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:50172:10"/>annulled. Now in the Creation of a Peer there are three things; the Perſon that creates, the Perſon that is created, the Matter of Record whereby he is created. Now if the King, who is the Perſon that creates, and his Succeſſors agree with the Perſon that is created Peer, and his Succeſſors, the one to undo their parts, and the other to give away their parts, and there is a Matter of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord of as high a nature concurring to effect this Diſſiolution, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in ſome Caſes 'tis in the power of an Anceſtor, by his own act, to deſtroy a Patent; as if a <hi>Scire Facias</hi> in <hi>Chancery</hi> be brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his Patent, and Matter is ſuggeſted whereby to avoid it, this ſhall (<hi>Bro. tit. Patent.</hi> 37, 97.) vacate whatſoever was crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Patent, and yet' tis there in the power of the Anceſtor, by good Pleading, to have ſupported the Patent, and by bad plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to deſtroy it; and therefore when the Foundation, which is the Patent, fails, the Honour, and whatever it be that is erected upon it, ſhall fail alſo: Every Eſtate by the conſent of all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons intereſted and concerned in the thing, may be taken away, for the Law is ſo ſet againſt Perpetuities, that a Clauſe intimating it is void, and tho' an Honour is not (<hi>Jones Rep.</hi> 109, 123.) aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, yet it may be extinguiſhed. It's true, if a Man hath but a part of an Eſtate, as only an Eſtate for Life, he can't alone paſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the whole Eſtate, but none who hath the Inheritance in Tail or in Fee, but he may deſtroy the whole, and tho' any one have but part, yet by the concurrence of all that are concerned, the whole may be deſtroyed: It is admitted if he commit Treaſon, and is attainted thereof, he loſeth the Honour for himſelf and his Poſterity; now 'twas in his power to do this act overt; and if by an act unlawful he hath power to defeat the deſcent of the Intail upon his Iſſue, there is the ſame reaſon that by a lawful act he ſhould part with it; there are two Acts of Parliament in force which fortifie the Fine; it muſt be granted that thoſe Honours are within the Statute <hi>de Donis,</hi> and then there can be no reaſon they ſhould not be within the Statutes of Fines, 4 <hi>Hen.</hi> 7. <hi>&amp;</hi> 34 <hi>H.</hi> 8. which ſay that Tenant in Tail may levie a Fine of all things that are intailable within the Statute <hi>de Donis,</hi> whatever therefore is within the one is within both: and it is not ſufficient to alledge that it is inconvenient that it ſhould be within the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of Fines; for there is an Act of Parliament, and without an Act of Parliament to exempt it, it can't be exempted: It may be proved by great variety of Precedents to have been the practiſe in former times, anciently nothing more frequent than to releaſe Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours. See <hi>Selden's Titles of Honours</hi> 730. it was as frequent as to grant them: In latter times (<hi>Delaval</hi>'s Caſe, 11 <hi>Rep.</hi> 1.) it hath been the Judgment of the Lords that Honours may be extinguiſhed, which in 1668. was certified by all the King's Counſel Learned in the Law to be good Authority. But to go a little higher, <hi>Andrew Gifford</hi> Baron <hi>Pomfret</hi> in Fee, 4 <hi>Hen.</hi> 3. <hi>Rot.</hi> 100. ſurrendred to the King: ſo 23 <hi>Hen.</hi> 3. <hi>Simon Mountford</hi> Eſq; Earl of <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> having a Mind to take an Honour from his eldeſt Son, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it upon his younger, and ſo it was ſurrendred and regranted
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:50172:10"/>accordingly. <hi>Selden</hi> ſeems to conſtrue this to be by way of Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion and not Surrender; yet others of later Authority (as <hi>Cambden</hi>'s <hi>Britan.</hi> Title <hi>Earl of Leiceſter</hi>) ſay expreſly that he did Surrender it; and <hi>Selden</hi> himſelf ſays it was by Concurrence of the King: King <hi>Hen.</hi> 3. (<hi>Rot. Cr.</hi> 24. <hi>men. E.</hi> 1.) created one Earl of <hi>Richmond,</hi> and he ſurrendred to the King (<hi>Cambden</hi>'s <hi>Brit.</hi> Title <hi>Earl of Richmond.</hi>) <hi>Roger de Bigod</hi> ſurrendred not only the Office of Earl Marſhal, but alſo the Earldom of <hi>Norfolk. William</hi> Duke of <hi>Juliers,</hi> whoſe Father came in with <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. was created Earl of <hi>Cambridge</hi> (40 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. <hi>m.</hi> 21.) in Fee, his Son ſurrenders to the King, which Record we have here: So <hi>Edward</hi> the Third made his Son <hi>John of Gaunt</hi> (See <hi>Cambden</hi>'s <hi>ubi ſupra</hi>) Earl of <hi>Richmond,</hi> who ſurrendred it to the King. And laſtly, in the Years 1639, 1679. <hi>Roger Stafford,</hi> whom the King intended to make a Viſcount, by the Advice of the Learned Men levied a Fine thereof, by which 'tis now enjoy'd. Laſtly, he argued <hi>ab inconvenienti,</hi> for no Lord in the Houſe will be in ſafety if it ſhould be other ways, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many ſitting in this Houſe by virtue of Surrenders from other Lords in former days, and perhaps ſome of their Heirs are alive; and ſo if theſe Surrenders be adjudged invalid, it would ſhake your Lordſhips own Poſſeſſions, and make it dubitable, whether For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners and Perſons unknown may not come and thruſt them out; but if not ſo, it may cauſe Confuſion amongſt themſelves, their former Honours having been ſurrendred to accept of others, and perhaps ſome, not thinking their Titles ſecure, will ſtick to the former, and ſo occaſion Diſpute and Confuſion about Preceden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; and laſtly, it will put a great Diſgrace upon your Anceſtors proceedings, who deemed this Courſe legal: and thoſe muſt ſhow very good Precedents that it hath been diſavowed, if they will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter ſuch conſtant Practiſes.</p>
            <p>In the next place 'twas anſwered to their Arguments and Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions: and as for that firſt Argument, That an Honour is inherent in the Blood; he anſwered, That this Inherency in the Blood is not eſſential to Honours, for an Honour may be created for Life, and then none of the Poſterity or Blood of the Peer is thereby enobled: It may be limited to the Heirs Males of the Body, ſo that an Honour may touch and enter far into the Blood, and yet not run with it; and farther, it may be limited to the Heirs by ſuch a Wife, there the Iſſue by the ſecond Venter ſhall never inherit the Dignity, and yet is as near to the Father, as thoſe that are by the firſt, ſo that 'tis no true ground that they go upon, that Nobility is inherent in the Blood; and for what was alledged as to the Inconveniency of Surrendering Dignities, he anſwered, That there may be neceſſary Reaſons for the extinguiſhment of an Honour, and it may be for the benefit and advantage of the Party and his Poſterity; as if it do happen that the Family do fall into Poverty, and be not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to ſupport the Honour of Peerage with decency, and ſo this Honour would perhaps be a Diſgrace to the reſt of the Lords; and in a Child's Caſe, it may happen to a Noble Family to have thoſe Afflictions, that to continue the Honour would expoſe the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:50172:11"/>Family to Infamy; and therefore ſome times, to prevent the Son of Adultery from his ſucceeding to the Dignity, it may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient to ſurrender it; and yet this cannot be without the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of the Prince, who being the Source of Honour, can beſt judge of the Reaſons for ſtopping the Stream; and it cannot ſeem an harder Caſe to diſinherit him of the Honour then of the Eſtate, which he may do; and if he leave his Honour without his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, it will be a Burden on his Shoulders which he will be una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to bear; and ſeeing it's neceſſary that there be a concurrence of the Prince, it is undecent to ſuppoſe ſo vile a thing of the Crown, as to comply with the Peeviſhneſs and Simplicity of the Parents, where there is no reaſon for it: And as for what hath been alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the Invalitity of thoſe Precedents that they were in Caſes of New Creations, and were in nature of Tranſmiſſions, he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, That when an Honour is Surrendred, and a new Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour granted, the former is either extinguiſhed, or not, before the other takes effect; if not, then the Party hath both together againſt the will of the Donor; and perhaps the new Honour may be of that Name and Place, and thoſe Perſons may be concerned in it, that will not permit it to be effected; and if it be in the power of the Anceſtor, for the advantage of his Poſterity, by the Surrender of one Honour to take a greater, it may be alſo in his power to do it for his prejudice. As to the Objection, That by the ſame Reaſon an Honour may be extinguiſhed it may alſo be Transferred; he anſwered, That there was a great diſparity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them; for as to Alienations of Honours, there's a great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon they ſhould be diſallowed, for they all flow from the Prince, and therefore 'tis not fit they ſhould be conferred on any but by the Prince; tho' the King's of <hi>England</hi> have granted power to a General to give the Honour of Knighthood, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in the Field, for the Reward and Incouragement of Valour; yet this granting of Nobility is a Prerogative peculiar to the King's Perſon alone; no Man elſe can ennoble another: Time was indeed, when the Earls of <hi>Cheſter,</hi> having Counties Palatine, by virtue of their <hi>Jura Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galia</hi> did create Barons, yet they never ſate in Parliament as Peers, becauſe Peerage being a thing of ſo high a nature, cannot be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by any but a Soveraign, and is given as a Truſt and Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſo that common Reaſon ſaith they are not transferrable. It is ſaid in our Law, that where Offices are granted to a Man in Fee (See <hi>Jones</hi> 122, 123.) he may grant it over; yet in ſome Caſes they are ſo near to the Crown, that they cannot be transferred, but muſt deſcend with the Blood, upon the ſame Reaſon no Man can ever transfer an Honour for the near Relation which it hath to the Crown; but in caſe of Extinguiſhment that Relation and Truſt ceaſeth, and ſo they are different Caſes. Then laſtly, as to the great Objection of the Judgment of the Houſe of Lords in <hi>Roger Stafford</hi>'s Caſe <hi>Anno</hi> 1640. he anſwered, That notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Caſe, their Lordſhips had given him leave to argue it, and therefore they intended not that ſhould be any Impediment. 2. That is no Judgment; for they being a Court of Judicature, do as other
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:50172:11"/>Judges, judge of the Matter before them only. Then the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion was, Whether an Honour could deſcend to the half Blood? They refetred it to the Judges, who were of Opinion that it ſhould. Thereupon ariſeth another Queſtion, Whether a Man might Convey or Transfer his Honour to another? 'Twas reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved he might not. This drew another Queſtion; whereupon they reſolved that a Lord could not Surrender his Dignity; the Original Cauſe was about a Deſcent to the half Blood, the Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution is he cannot Surrender; how then can they pretend that to be a Judgment, when the Queſtion in point of Judgment was not before them. Suppoſe it had been reſolved (and it's a wonder it had not all that time) that a Lord could not forfeit, and that had been a third ſtep to have made it a perfect Buſineſs; for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the times, it had been a moſt convenient Reſolution: But beſides all that, the King's Counſel were never heard in the point, and the rejecting the Opinions of Learned Men, ſhows it was no Reſolution of the whole Houſe, tho' entred upon the Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, and therefore he prayed Judgment againſt the Petitioner.</p>
            <p>The Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> ſpoke in the Houſe for the Petitioner.</p>
            <p>The ſtreſs of the Argument for the King in this Caſe is found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon theſe two Aſſertions:</p>
            <p n="1">1 That Honours are taken to be within the Statute <hi>de Donis, &amp;c.</hi> and the general Rules of that Statute;</p>
            <p n="2">2. And then ſecondly, That Honours are to be governed as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Inheritances, by the Rule of the Common Law.</p>
            <p>As for the firſt, it hath not been proved; for the Reſolution in <hi>Nevil</hi>'s Caſe 2 <hi>Jac.</hi> was Extrajudicial, and no Judgment of any Cauſe before them; and in ſuch Caſes the Judges do not hold them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be upon Oath; and if there be two or more of another Opinion, they do not refuſe to ſign the Reſolution of the major part, and ſo it goes under the denomination of all the Judges; but if it were a Judgment of them altogether, they could neither alter nor make new the Law, neither could they make that intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed within the Statute <hi>de Donis, &amp;c.</hi> which was not in being till many Ages after, <hi>Beauchamp</hi> in <hi>Richard</hi> the Second's time being the firſt Honour that was entailed by Patent.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The ſecond Aſſertion is contrary to the Opinion of the moſt Learned Men, the Honour and Dignity of the Houſe, the conſtant practiſe of <hi>Weſtminſter-hall,</hi> and the direct Evidence of the thing it ſelf. Juſtice <hi>Berkley,</hi> a very learned Judge, declared his Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion <hi>Febr.</hi> 6. 1640. as appears by the Records of this Houſe, That Honours deſcend from the firſt that was ſeized of them; contrary to the Rules of other Inheritances; and that Honours are not go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by the Rules of the Common Law. Juſtice <hi>Dodderidge,</hi> in <hi>Jones</hi> 207. is of opinion, That Honours are Perſonal Dignities which are affixed to the Blood; the Lords never yet ſuffered their Honours to be tried at any Court at Law, or any other where, ſave before themſelves, tho' their other Inheritances are tried there
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:50172:12"/>as well as other Mens: So <hi>poſſeſſio fratris</hi> holds of Lands, but not of a Dignity, which is not diſpoſed of as other Inheritances, nor will it be guided by the ſtrict Rules of Law. The Lord <hi>Coke</hi> is of Opinion in <hi>Bedford</hi>'s Caſe, That an Honour could not be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away but by Act of Parliament; therefore it will be allowed that the concurrence of all Parties concerned may extinguiſh this as well as other Inheritances, but the Concurrence of all can't be without Act of Parliament; for the whole Kingdom have an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in the Peerage of every Lord: It is a dangerous Doctrine to ſay our Judicature and Legiſlature is our own only. The Houſe of Lords is the next thing to the Crown, tho' that be far above them; yet thoſe that reach at that, muſt take them out of the way firſt; they were voted uſeleſs and dangerous before the Crown was laid aſide; and as in Deſcent of the Crown the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom hath ſuch an Intereſt in it, as the King cannot Surrender or alien it, ſo in a proportionable degree, tho' far leſs, the King and Kingdom have an Intereſt in their Lordſhips, and Dignities, and Titles. It is true they may be forfeited, but it doth not follow that they may be extinguiſhed by Surrender. There be two Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for the Forfeiture:</p>
            <p n="1">1. There is a Condition in Law that they ſhall be true and loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al to the Government.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Honours are inherent in the Blood, and when that is cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, that which is inherent is taken away; but in caſe of a Surrender theſe Reaſons do not hold; there is no Breach of any Condition in Law, nor any Corruption of the Blood; for theſe Reaſons Felony without Clergy forfeits Honours; whereas other Inheritances, tho' Fee-ſimple, are loſt but for a year and a day, and ſo are Freeholds for Lives; which is another clear Inſtance that Honours are not governed by the Rules of Law. It is preſſed as a known Law, that Honours are grantable for Lives; a Point of greater Conſequence than the Thing in debate: It's not a fair way of arguing, nor to be allowed of. As for the Precedents that are <hi>Selden</hi> 730. is expreſly againſt them; for it ſaith that the Honour of Baronages were in Abbots only in right of their Abbies, not inherent in them: So that 'tis plainly inferred that other Honours are Perſonal Dignities. The Lord <hi>Delaware</hi>'s Caſe 11 <hi>Rep.</hi> makes nothing for them; for it doth not follow, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he could not Surrender that which was not in him, therefore he might Surrender that which was in him. As to the other Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedents, he gave theſe three Reaſons:</p>
            <p n="1">1. They were bare Surrenders, no Fines.</p>
            <p n="2">2. All thoſe were made by Perſons that had advantage by them, having greater Honours granted unto them; or ſuch whoſe Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt was beyond the Seas, and therefore were willing to quit their Dependencies here upon good Conſiderations that pleaſed them: <hi>Et volenti non ſit Injuria.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. All theſe Surrenders paſſed <hi>ſub ſilentio,</hi> and never admitted of any Diſpute: But as for the ſole melancholy Precedent of <hi>Roger Stafford</hi> 1638. which was condemned in Parliament 1640. 'tis to be
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:50172:12"/>obſerved that Reſolution can't be condemned becauſe of the Times, for the Affront to the Lords, in taking ſuch a Fine, was in 1638. and when could it be more properly remedied then in 1640. ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it be expected there were a Prophetical Spirit of Judgment againſt a thing not in being; there were 94 Lords preſent; and the Vote was <hi>Nemine Contradicente,</hi> which gives it as great an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority as any Reſolution that ever was. The King's Counſel were not heard in the Caſe of Ship-money, nor Knighthood-money, where they had more right to claim to be heard than in this Caſe. To conclude, a Fine is a Judgment in the <hi>Common Pleas,</hi> and your Lordſhips Honours are not triable in that Court below in <hi>Weſtmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter-hall;</hi> but if this Fine be allowable, they muſt be triable there as well as other Inheritances. And as to what has been ſaid, That ſome of your Lordſhips ſit here by Remainders, and they are in danger, if Honours be not allowed, to be intailed, it's denied; and if they be intailed, it's not of the ſame nature with other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritances; neither doth any Lord ſit here by Title of a Remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, but by Virtue of a new Grant in the ſame Patent.</p>
            <p>'Twas afterwards declared, That the Lords Spiritual and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral in Parliament aſſembled, upon a very long Debate, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving heard his Majeſty's Attorney General, are unanimouſly of Opinion, and do reſolve and adjudge that no fine levied, or at any time hereafter to be levied to the King, can bar a Peer's Title of Honour, or the Right of any Perſon claiming ſuch Title under him that levied, or ſhall levie ſuch Fine.</p>

            <p>Upon the General Error aſſigned here in the Judgment, and Affirmance aforeſaid, the ſingle Query was, If theſe words, <hi>He is diſaffected to the Government,</hi> be actionable? And it was argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Counſel for the Plaintiff in the Writ of Error, that they were not, becauſe they are general and uncertain, do not import any particular Crime which expoſes to any particular Penalty, and they carry no Reference to his Office; and tho' he be alledged to be a Juſtice of the Peace, yet there's no <hi>Colloquium</hi> laid concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Office. To make words actionable, they muſt either tend to the Scandal and Diſcredit of the Party, or ſuch, if true, as muſt bring Damage to the Party, of whom they are ſpoken: o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, without ſpecial Damage laid and proved, there's no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for the Jury to give Damages, becauſe he ſuffers none. In an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient time theſe Actions were rare; the <hi>Year-Books</hi> are little ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with them; and tho' latter Ages have countenanced them, yet it hath been under certain Rules and Limitations, as that they ought to be particular and clear; for if they are ſo general as to be ambiguous, no Action is warrantable upon them; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they muſt be of a ſingle and known Senſe, and ſuch againſt which no other Intendment can reaſonably be admitted; Slander raiſed by Argument, or Implication, or Inference only, is not enough to maintain an Action: And tho' the <hi>Cauſa dicendi</hi> be not inquirable now, after a Jury hath found them ſpoken as laid, <hi>viz.</hi> maliciouſly, yet if the words themſelves do not imply Malice and Damage, the uſe of thoſe Adverbs which are commonly mention'd in ſuch Declarations, will not alter the Caſe; for Men are to be anſwerable only for their own words, and not for words ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded or deſcribed in another manner than the Speaker intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: Here the word <hi>diſaffected</hi> is none of the plaineſt; nor is the word <hi>Government</hi> much plainer; the firſt is only a Negative, and to ſay <hi>He is not affected to the Government,</hi> goes only to a want of Zeal, or an indifference of Temper, and doth not carry in it any treaſonable Intent or Purpoſe, much leſs any Act done.</p>
            <p>And as to the pretended Special Damage, in the loſs of his Prince's Favour, or incurring his Diſpleaſure, that is ſuch an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legation as ſhould not have been made, 'tis neither mannerly nor juſtifiable in the Plaintiff to affirm ſuch a thing upon Record. And as to the loſs of his Office, that can be no Damage, the ſame being no Place of Profit, but meerly of burden and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. 'Twas further urged, That if theſe words were allowed to be actionable, <hi>Tory, Whig,</hi> or <hi>Jacobite,</hi> or any other common, rude, uncertain Terms in Diſcourſe might pretend to it, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the reſpective Turn of Times, and conſequently no Body would know what Diſcourſe is allowable: As ill Tongues were to be corrected, ſo care is to be had of Liberty of Speech, not to make every thing a Cauſe of Action; and to juſtifie this, on the ſame ſide were quoted multitude of Caſes, too many to deſerve a remembrance.</p>
            <pb n="15" facs="tcp:50172:14"/>
            <p>It was argued on the other ſide, That theſe words toucht the Perſon in the moſt tender point, <hi>viz.</hi> his Loyalty; That it car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried Scandal in it ſelf, not to be zealouſly affected to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which protects the whole; that it was equivalent in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Underſtanding, to the calling him <hi>Traytor</hi> or <hi>Rebel:</hi> That this was much more, than affirming one not to be a <hi>good Man;</hi> that <hi>diſaffected</hi> implyed ſomewhat poſitive; it's meaning was, that the Party hath an averſion, a fixed, ſettled Enmity to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; that this was ſpoken of an Officer of great Truſt; that 'twas a Reflection upon him with regard to his Office, for Loyal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is as neceſſary as Juſtice in ſuch a Poſt; that to ſlander him in the one, ought to be as actionable as to ſlander him in the other; which is allowed it will, becauſe of the Reference to the Office in the nature of the words, without any Special Damage: that to deny theſe words to be actionable, would tend to encourage Brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of the Peace, by provoking Challenges, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for that, if Men cannot relieve themſelves by Law, they will be tempted to do it of themſelves in other methods; and that theſe words were a Reflection on the Government, which employed Men thus diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affected; and abundance of the Common Caſes upon this Subject were quoted, to ſhew what words would bear an Action in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of Officers and Allegiance: And then 'twas argued ſtrenuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that this was a Special Damage, <hi>viz.</hi> to loſe the Prince's Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, which every Man ought to covet, and to loſe a Place of Honour and Command, both which the Jury have Found.</p>
            <p>It was replyed on the behalf of the Plaintiff in the Writ of Error, That as to the Reflection on the Government, it might perhaps warrant an Information or Indictment, but not an Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: That as to Challenges, there were vaſt variety of words which are reckoned provocative in the higheſt degree, As the giving the <hi>Lie,</hi> calling a Man a <hi>Coward,</hi> and the like, and yet will bear no Action: And at laſt, upon Debate, the Judgment was Reverſed.</p>

               <hi>John Duvall</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth</hi> his Wife, Appellants, <hi>Verſus William Terrey</hi> of <hi>London</hi> Merchant, Reſpondent.</head>
            <p>THE Appeal was to be relieved againſt a Decree in <hi>Chance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry:</hi> The Caſe was, That the Appellant <hi>Elizabeth</hi> had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into a Bond of 140 <hi>l.</hi> Penalty, conditioned for the payment of 72 <hi>l.</hi> on the Twentieth of <hi>April</hi> 1676. and by reaſon of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Promiſes and Delays of Payment, and inſiſting upon Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and other like Occaſions, it was not put in Suit till lately, and then the Reſpondents were Arreſted: And upon a Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Appellants pleaded Payment at the Day. And after
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:50172:15"/>Iſſue joyned, and notice of Trial, upon ſome diſcovery of a Defect in the Evidence to prove the Bond, Motion was made in the <hi>King's Bench</hi> to alter the Plea; which denied, a Bill was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred in <hi>Chancery,</hi> on ſuggeſtion that <hi>Elizabeth</hi> had never Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted it, or that 'twas obtained by Fraud, and that there was no Conſideration for the ſame; and the Reſpondent preferred a Bill, praying a Diſcovery if ſuch Bond, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Upon Examination of Witneſſes, and after publication paſſed, the Cauſe was heard; and upon the hearing, 'twas ordered, That the Appellants ſhould not be relieved, ſave againſt the Penalty of the Bond; and that it be referred to one of the Maſters to compute the Principal-money and Intereſt due thereon, and to tax for the Reſpondent, his Coſts, both at Law and in that Court; and that what ſhould be found due for the Principal, Intereſt, and Coſts, be paid by the Appellants at ſuch Time and Place as the Maſter ſhould appoint, who computed the Principal and Intereſt at 154 <hi>l.</hi> and the Coſts at 67 <hi>l.</hi> and to be paid the Twentieth of <hi>October</hi> following.</p>
            <p>Upon the hearing of this Appeal, there were two Queries made, 1. Whether, there being ſome difference in and about the proof of the Bond, the Court ought to have made a Decree without directing a Trial at Law upon the validity of the Bond: But 'twas held, That the Bond not being denied in pleading upon the Iſſue at Law, the <hi>Chancery</hi> had done right, and could not well have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected any other Iſſue than what the Parties themſelves had joyned in at Law; and tho' 'twas pretended that the Attorney ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> pleaded thus without direction, the Court did not much regard that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, becauſe of the proper Remedy which the Law gives againſt ſuch an Attorney, if the pretence were true, and therefore they did not much conſider that.</p>
            <p>Another Query was, Whether the <hi>Court of Equity</hi> could juſtly award more than the Penalty? and objected, that the Order be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſave againſt the Penalty, no more ought to have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed. But 'twas ſaid, That notwithſtanding that, when the ſame was referred to a Maſter to tax Principal and Intereſt, the Order bound the Party to pay both, tho' it amounted to more than the Penalty; and the meaning of the firſt part was only to relieve againſt the Penalty, in caſe the Principal and Intereſt came to leſs than the Penal Sum; eſpecially the ſame coming to be heard upon croſs Bills, and as this Caſe was circumſtanced, after ſuch delay and ſuch pleading in the Court of <hi>King's Bench:</hi> And as to Coſts, held no cauſe for an Appeal in this Caſe; nor in truth was it ever known to be a Cauſe, if the Merits were againſt the party Appellant. And ſo the Decree was affirmed in the whole.</p>

               <hi>William Dolphin</hi> and <hi>Katharine</hi> his Wife, Appellants, <hi>Verſus Francis Haynes</hi> Reſpondent.</head>
            <p>APpeal to be relieved againſt a Decree in <hi>Chancery</hi> made by the Maſter of the Rolls, <hi>Nov.</hi> 10. 1696. The Caſe was thus, That one <hi>Paris Slaughter</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> being Guardian to <hi>Ka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tharine</hi> the Appellant during her Infancy, he placed her with his Kinſman <hi>Chambers Slaughter</hi> near <hi>Worceſter,</hi> and ſometimes board<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her in that place for her Education; and the Reſpondent and the ſaid <hi>P.S.</hi> being Correſpondents, <hi>Paris Slaughter</hi> ordered the Reſpondent to pay the ſaid <hi>Chambers</hi> what Sums ſhould be called for upon the account of <hi>Katharine:</hi> In purſuance whereof ſeveral Sums were paid upon her account, and the ſame were allowed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to the Reſpondent by <hi>P. S.</hi> The Appellant <hi>Katharine</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving juſt attained her Age, ſhe came to the Reſpondent, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired more Money, as by the Order of <hi>P. S.</hi> and accordingly two ſeveral Sums were paid her, and Receipts taken from her, as by the Order of <hi>P. S.</hi> The Appellant <hi>Katharine</hi> did afterwards come to an account with <hi>P. S.</hi> which was fairly ſtated in Writing, and they executed General Releaſes each to the other: But the ſaid two Sums, not being entred in the Books of <hi>P. S.</hi> were not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted for by the Appellant <hi>Katharine;</hi> and the Reſpondent not having received any Allowance from <hi>P. S.</hi> in his Life time, nor having, as he thought, any ſufficient Orders to charge the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutor of <hi>P. S.</hi> with, he prefers his Bill againſt the Appellants, and by her Anſwer ſhe own'd the Receipt of the two Sums, but by order of <hi>P. S.</hi> and afterwards, upon hearing of the Cauſe, The Court declared that there appearing no poſitive orders from <hi>P. S.</hi> for theſe two Sums, the Appellants ought to pay the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal, Intereſt, and Coſts: And a Decree was made accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly.</p>
            <p>And now it was argued on the behalf of the Appellants, That this was not juſt, becauſe the Reſpondent never paid any Money to any Body while <hi>Katharine</hi> boarded with him, or afterwards, but by the Order and upon the Credit of <hi>P.S.</hi> and charged it to his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count; and the Reſpondent did not pretend but that all was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paid him, excepting theſe two Sums; that the Reſpondent and <hi>Katharine</hi> had never any Account or Dealings together upon her Credit; and 'tis to be preſumed that the Reſpondent hath charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed theſe Sums upon the Account of <hi>P. S.</hi> and not to her Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, becauſe the Receipts are ſo worded; and that <hi>Katharine</hi> had releaſed <hi>P. S.</hi> on their accounting together, and therefore ſhe could not charge the Executor of <hi>P. S.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the other ſide, it was argued, That here was a Badge of Fraud in the Appellant <hi>K,</hi> that upon her Account with <hi>P. S.</hi> no mention was had of theſe Sums; that the Debt was originally hers; that ſhe was obliged to pay it, either to <hi>Slaughter</hi> or to
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:50172:16"/>
               <hi>Haynes;</hi> that not having paid the ſame to <hi>Slaughter,</hi> and <hi>Slaughter</hi> having releaſed to her, ſhe was diſcharged from all Demands on that ſide, and therefore 'twas the more reaſonable it ſhould be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered by her to the Reſpondent; that tho' the Credit might be at firſt given to <hi>Slaughter,</hi> yet the Money being paid to her, and not by her paid to <hi>Slaughter, Haynes</hi> had a fair Claim againſt her, even to avoid circuity of Suits; for if this were otherwiſe, 'twould only turn <hi>Haynes</hi> upon the Executor of <hi>Slaughter,</hi> and that Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutor upon <hi>Katharine</hi> the Appellant again in Equity to ſet aſide the Releaſe, and to have an allowance of theſe Sums; and that in Juſtice and Equity the Charge was placed upon the proper Party, who at firſt was the Debtor for what ſhe thus received: And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly the Decree was affirmed.</p>

            <p>APpeal from a Decree of Diſmiſſion of a Bill preferred in the Court of <hi>Chancery:</hi> The Caſe was thus,</p>
            <p>The Appellants did in the Year 1693. load on Board the Ship <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> at <hi>Gallipoly</hi> 210 Tuns of Oyls, of which Ship the Appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants were Owners; and the Reſpondents loaded on Board her at <hi>Meſſina</hi> 85 Bales of Silk, upon Freight by Contract both to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered at <hi>London.</hi> The Ship homeward bound was chaſed into <hi>Malaga Mould</hi> by one of the <hi>Thoulon</hi> Fleet, who were three or four days in ſight, then ſtood in for that Port, as if deſigned to attack the Fort; and thereupon the Maſter diſcourſed the Owner's Factor, who ſent him off a Lighter to ſave what they could of the Ships Cargo; and becauſe the Silk was of the greateſt value, the Silk was put on board the Lighter, and carried aſhore; and to come at the Silk, (for it lay beyond the Oyls) they were forced to rummage the Ship: In ſaving of which, and ſome ſmall part of the Oyls, many hours were ſpent, and by the Seamen only, and at Night the <hi>French</hi> left the Port, whereupon no more was land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But about ſix days afterwards the <hi>French</hi> Fleet appeared a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain before <hi>Malaga,</hi> and then all Endeavours were uſed to ſave the Oyls, but were prevented by the Boats which the <hi>French</hi> Men of War ſent into the Harbour, and the Enemy forced them to their Guns, and when they could defend the Ship no longer, they bored holes to ſink her, but the Oyls kept her from ſinking, and the <hi>French</hi> took her, and carried her away. The Bales of Silk were afterwards put on board another Ship, and delivered to the Reſpondents at <hi>London,</hi> for which they paid the Freight, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="19" facs="tcp:50172:16"/>
            <p>The Appellants pretending that they ought to have a ſhare of the Silk which was ſaved, in proportion to the value of the Ship and Oyls which were loſt, they exhibited their Bill in <hi>Chancery,</hi> to enforce the Reſpondents to come to an Average with the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellants for the loſs of their Ship and Oyls. And after Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of Witneſſes, on the hearing of the Cauſe, the Bill was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed.</p>
            <p>And it was argued on the behalf of the Appellants, That this Diſmiſſion was not juſtifiable by the Rules of Equity; for that it muſt be agreed, If Goods are thrown overboard in ſtreſs of Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or in danger or juſt fear of Enemy, in order to ſave the Ship and reſt of the Cargo, that which is ſaved ſhall contribute to a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of that which is loſt, and the Owners ſhall be Contributors in proportion; and that there was the ſame Reaſon here; that by preferring the ſalvage of the Silk (being the beſt of the Cargo) before the Oyls, the Owners were deprived of the ſame opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity for the ſalvage of the Oyls; that as the Sea-law in Extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty directs the Maſter to preſerve the beſt of his Cargo, and the Goods ſaved ought to contribute to the loſs of the Goods Ejected; ſo where one is preferred before the other in caſe of Extremity, there being not time to land the whole, average is juſt and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable. And as to the ſix days time, there was then no appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of danger, and conſequently the Maſter could not juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the landing of any thing after the reaſon of their Fears were removed.</p>
            <p>That the prudence of their Maſter in ſaving the Silk before the Oyls, ought not to be to the prejudice of the Owners intereſt, the Oyls lying next to be preſerved; that the pretended neglect of the Maſter, in not landing them during the abſence of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, is no Excuſe, becauſe then there was no danger; that the ſaying that the loſs of the Ship and Oyls did not contribute to the ſalvage of the Silks, is no reaſon, ſeeing the ſalvage of the Silk (which had otherwiſe been loſt) deprived the Owners of the ſame opportunity for the ſalvage of the other Goods; that in ſuch Adventures, as the danger is common, ſo ought the loſs or da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage to be common and equal; that the Maſter is equally intruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by and for all; and were it otherwiſe, it had been the Duty, and will be the Intereſt of all Owners of Ships to order their Servants in Extremity to preſerve their own Goods; that the Silk, being of the greateſt value, it was a National Service, to preſerve that before the Oyls, and therefore equitable that all who embark in the ſame Bottom, ſhould ſhare alike in the Service done for Salvage, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And further, that if in Extremity, the ſafety of the beſt of the Ships Cargo is not preferrable before that of the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er value, it will be of ill conſequence; and therefore the Sea-law provides firſt for the Safety of the beſt of the Cargo, and the Maſter acted accordingly and that 'tis the Opinion of thoſe who are learned in the Maritime Laws, That where Freighters Goods are equally in danger, and a like opportunity for the ſalvage thereof, if the ſafety of the one be preferred, and the other comes to be
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:50172:17"/>loſt, ſuch preference obliges the Goods preſerved to contribute to thoſe which are loſt; it being a General Rule in Cauſes Maritime, That one Man's Intereſt ought not to ſuffer for the Safety of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
            <p>On the other ſide, it was argued with the Decree, That this Pretence was new; that 'twas a Notion unpreſidented; that the Rule of Averidge went only to the caſes, where the loſs of one Man's Goods contributed to the ſafety of anothers, as by Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Veſſel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and not to this Caſe; that here each Man was to undergo the Peril of his own Goods; that in caſe of Damage to Goods within the Veſſel, other Goods were not contributory, but the Owner muſt endure his own loſs, and had only his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy againſt the Maſter, if it were occaſioned by his Defect or Miſcarriage: that the reaſon of Averidge was a meritorious Conſideration in the common Caſe, becauſe there the loſs of one did actually ſave the other; but here was no ſuch thing: The loſs of theſe Oyls did not ſave the Silk, nor did the ſaving of the Silk loſe the Oyls; for if the Silk had not been ſaved, the Oyls had been loſt, for they were ſo bulky that they could not eaſily be removed without further time; and if part only be ſaved, 'tis to the advantage of the Owner; and where all can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſaved at a time, the Benefit is accidental to him, whoſe Goods the Maſter's diſcretion directs to be ſaved: And in this caſe here was no ſuch Commodity, as could contribute to the loſs of a Ship, if it had been kept on Board; for the Silk, if on Board, had not aſſiſted to her ſinking. But beſides, here were ſix or eight days between the landing of the Silk and the ſeiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Ship by the <hi>French,</hi> in which time all the Oyls might have been landed, and thereby both them and the Ship ſaved; and the apprehenſion of the Danger could not ſo ſoon be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved by loſing ſight of the Enemy in the Morning, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there was no reaſon for the Maſter immediately to forbear landing his Oyls. Therefore 'twas prayed that the Appeal might be diſmiſſed, and the ſame was accordingly done, and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of Diſmiſſion below affirmed.</p>

            <p>APpeal from a Decree in <hi>Chancery:</hi> The Caſe was thus, Sir <hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence Stoughton,</hi> a young Baronet in <hi>Surrey,</hi> having an Eſtate of near 1000 <hi>l. per Annum,</hi> was a Servant to the Reſpondent <hi>Mary,</hi> the Daughter of one <hi>Burnaby</hi> a Brewer, reputed to be very rich. Upon the firſt Propoſal of Marriage, <hi>Burnaby</hi> did agree to give 5000 <hi>l.</hi> certain, and inſiſted to have a Jointure of 500 <hi>l. per An.</hi>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:50172:17"/>ſettled, and that ſhe ſhould have the Inheritance of the Jointure, if he died without Iſſue. Sir <hi>Lawrence</hi> did refuſe to agree to this; but afterwards he renewed the Treaty himſelf, and accepted of Articles for payment of 5000 <hi>l.</hi> Portion, and made a Settlement of a Jointure of Lands worth 500 <hi>l. per Annum;</hi> and likewiſe made another Deed in the nature of a Mortgage of all his Eſtate, as well the Reverſion of her Jointure as the reſt, for ſecuring the payment of 5000 <hi>l.</hi> to her in caſe Sir <hi>Lawrence</hi> died without Iſſue; and died within a Fortnight after Marriage, without Iſſue. The Lady <hi>Stoughton</hi> prefers her Bill, and prays the Appellants might be fore-cloſed of the Equity of Redemption on Failure of Payment. The Appellants exhibit their Bill to be relieved againſt this as a Fraud; and upon hearing of theſe Cauſes before the Maſter of the Rolls, the Appellants were decreed to pay the 5000 <hi>l.</hi> by the firſt Day of <hi>Hillary</hi> Term, 1695. without Intereſt, but with Coſts: And in default, the eſtate to be ſold to raiſe it with Intereſt from that Day: And upon a re-hearing before the Lord Keeper, his Lordſhip confirmed the Decrees, and gave a Twelve-months further time for payment.</p>
            <p>And now it was argued for the Appellant, That it was proved in the Cauſe, that Sir <hi>Lawrence</hi> was a ſickly weak Man; that on his Death-bed he declared he had made no ſuch Agreement; but that the 5000 <hi>l.</hi> was to pay his Debts, and no part of it was to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to his Wife, and his Wife preſent, and not contradicting it; that it did not appear, that he had any Counterpart of this Deed, or that he ever adviſed or acquainted any of his own Relations with it; and the Draught of the Deed was confeſſed to be burnt. And further, that the Agreement in its own nature was unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; that ſhe ſhould have both Portion and Jointure; and that one was a merit for the other; but that both ſhould be veſted in the ſame Perſon, the Portion returned, and the Jointure enjoyed, was very hard, and therefore to be ſet aſide: That Equity was to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve againſt ſuch pretended Agreements, as things done without any Conſideration inducing them, and therefore void.</p>
            <p>On the other ſide, 'twas inſiſted on for the Decree, That the Man was of Age; that there were two Treaties of Marriage, which ſhews a deliberation; that here was no miſ-repreſentation or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition; the Bargain in it ſelf might be upon good reaſon; the Gentleman being ſickly; and the Money was to be returned only upon a Contingency of his dying without Iſſue; that in caſe of his having Iſſue, the Agreement was common; that perhaps ſhe had the worſt on't under all Circumſtances; that all Bargains are not to be ſet aſide, becauſe not ſuch as the wiſeſt People would make; but there muſt be Fraud to make void their Acts; and his forgetting that he had done ſuch an Act, when on his Death-bed, is no reaſon for to annul it; and the Marriage had been a good Conſideration for a Jointure of it ſelf: And reaſonable or unreaſonable is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways the queſtion in Equity, if each Party was acquainted with the whole, and meant what they did; much leſs is it ſufficient to ſay that 'twas unreaſonable as it hapned in event; for if at the time
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:50172:18"/>'twas a tolerable Bargain; nay, if at the time this Bargain was the meaning of the Parties, and each knew what was done, and neither was deceived, the ſame muſt ſtand: And accordingly the Decree was affirmed.</p>

            <p>In <hi>Trinity</hi> 1692. the Attorney General prefers a Bill againſt the Appellant as Heir at Law to ſettle and eſtabliſh the ſaid Charities, and to enforce the Truſtees to act or to transfer their truſt Eſtate. To which they anſwer, and the Heir by his Anſwer claimed as Heir at Law, the Surplus of the Charity Eſtate over and above what would ſatisfie the yearly Payments expreſſed in the Will, and the Charges of executing the ſaid Truſt; upon a Reference to a Maſter, to aſcertain the Court of the yearly value of the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor; he reports it worth 240 <hi>l. per Annum,</hi> and worth the ſame at the time of making the Will. And on hearing the Cauſe, the Court declared, That all the Profits of the Premiſſes, ought by the purport and intention of the Will, to be applied to the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities therein mentioned; and that the Appellant <hi>Arnold</hi> the Heir at Law is totally excluded from the Surplus, with direction how
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:50172:18"/>the Surplus ſhould go in augmentation of ſome of the Charities; nevertheleſs, in caſe the Appellant ſhould Seal and Execute to the Truſtees a Releaſe and Conveyance of the Premiſſes, according to the Decree, then he to have his Coſts out of the Sale of Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and that the Truſtees be indempnified.</p>
            <p>And it was argued on behalf of the Appellant, That this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree was not equitable. Some Queſtions were made about the diſtribution of the Surplus amongſt only ſome of the Charities, and about the value; but a Surplus was agreed to be in the Caſe; and 'twas chiefly inſiſted upon, that the Surplus ought to go and be to and for the uſe of the Heir at Law; for that the Eſtate is not increaſed by any ſubſequent or accidental Improvement, and ſo not like the Caſe of <hi>Thetford</hi> School; but here at the time of making the ſaid Will, was, and now is, of a good value beyond the Sums given, and was ſo known to be by the Teſtator; and the particular Charities given by the Teſtator are particularly and expreſly named and limited, and do amount only to ſo much, as is leſs than the value of the Land; and thS urplus is not diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of, and conſequently ought to be the Heirs: For as at the Common Law in a Will, what is not given away muſt deſcend, whether you ſpeak of Land, or the intereſt in it; ſo in Equity, whatſoever Truſt, or part of a Truſt, is not declared and expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, the ſame ſhall be for the benefit of the Repreſentative of the Teſtator, either Heir or Executor, as the Caſe may happen: Then theſe Bequeſts or Deviſes being particular and expreſs, they do and will controul and expound, nay reſtrain and qualifie the meaning of general precedent words: That Expreſſion of his being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to ſettle his Mannor to charitable Uſes, will be qualified by the Particulars afterwards, as is <hi>Nokes</hi>'s Caſe in 4 <hi>Rep.</hi> and many others in the Books. Beſides, 'tis not accompanied with any term of Univerſality, that excludes the Conſtruction contended for; and if it had been ſo largely expreſſed, thoſe general words of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning to ſettle the whole, may be intended only as a Security, that the particular Charities may be certainly anſwered: And by ſuch Conſtruction all the words of the Will may be ſatisfied; and then the Truſtees may convey the Premiſſes to the Heir at Law, and take Security for the ſame, ſaving and reſerving all the ſaid Charities deviſed, with all reaſonable Charges and Deducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, without prejudice to the Will of the Teſtator, or to the ſaid Eſtate, which muſt nevertheleſs be liable to anſwer and make good the ſame; ſo that there can be no Damage done to any of the Parties or Intereſts concerned, by this Conſtruction; nay, it is the adding a further Security for their payment. Now it is plain, he deſigned the Sums given to the particular Uſes, and no more, for that they are all ſo particular and expreſs; and it is purſuant to the Rules of Law and Equity, in all doubtful Caſes, to adjudge in favour of the Heir at Law, and not to extend the general words of a Will, to enlarge a Charity beyond the intent expreſſed, eſpecially againſt a near Relation and Heir, as this is, <hi>viz.</hi> his Brother's Son.
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:50172:19"/>Beſides, the Teſtator was bred a Civilian, and as ſuch, knew how fully to expreſs himſelf, if he had intended the Overplus to go in increaſe of the Charity: Or if he had intended them more then is mentioned, he would have declared himſelf in ſuch manner as ſhould exclude all doubt.</p>
            <p>On the other ſide, it was argued, That the Teſtator's intent plainly appeared by his Will to diſpoſe all his Eſtate wholly to charitable Uſes; and that the words of the Will were ſufficient to carry the whole Eſtate to that purpoſe; and that it did not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear by his Will, that 'twas his intent to give his Heir at Law any thing out of his Real Eſtate; that his determination to ſettle his Mannor, with the Appurtenances, was to ſettle the whole; that what is not diſpoſed of in Particulars, is to be directed by the Court of <hi>Chancery;</hi> that that Court hath done right in directing it in augmentation of the Charities mentioned, becauſe the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtator's intent was moſt in favour of thoſe which are ſo mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: That if the Query were askt, What ſhall be done with the Surplus, if any? The Anſwer is natural, <hi>viz.</hi> I am determined to ſettle the Mannor, that is the whole, on Charitable Uſes: That the Teſtator by his Will expreſſed ſome Care for his Siſter, and for <hi>John Boncher</hi> his Nephew, and other his near Relations; but neither by any Expreſſion or Implication, pointeth at any provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion deſigned for his Heir at Law; but for the Excluding him of all Pretences, hath bequeathed him 40 <hi>s.</hi> and no more: that the other is to contradict his plain Intent; 'tis to make a new Will for him, contrary to the determination which he ſaith he had made: And accordingly the Decree was affirmed.</p>

            </p>
            <p>That he, before his departure, by virtue of the ſaid Letters Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, by a certain Commiſſion under his Hand and Seal, did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute the Plaintiff, in his abſence, to be his Deputy Governour in the ſaid Iſlands of <hi>Barbadoes,</hi> to do and execute the Powers and Authorities granted to the Defendant by the ſaid Letters Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents.</p>
            <p>That the firſt of <hi>Auguſt</hi> following, the Defendant arrived at <hi>London</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> that the fourth of <hi>May,</hi> 35 <hi>Car.</hi> 2. after the Defendants departure, the Plaintiff took upon himſelf the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of the Government of the Iſland of <hi>Barbadoes;</hi> that the Plaintiff, not regarding the Truſt repoſed in him by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant, nor the Honour of that Supreme Place and Office, did unlawfully and arbitrarily execute that Government and Office to the Oppreſſion of the King's Subjects, <hi>viz. apud Lond' praed' in Par' &amp; Ward' praed'.</hi>

            <p>The Plaintiff demurred, and the Defendant joyn'd in Demurrer, and Judgment was given for the Plaintiff; and a <hi>Venire</hi> awarded <hi>tam ad triand' exitum quam ad inquirend' de dampnis,</hi> &amp;c. and the Iſſue was found <hi>pro quaerent',</hi> and 6 <hi>d.</hi> Damages, and on the Demur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer 500 <hi>l.</hi> Damages, and Judgment for Damages and Coſts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounting in the whole to 590 <hi>l.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Plaintiff, Sir <hi>J. Witham,</hi> dying, <hi>Trin.</hi> 2 <hi>Wil. &amp; Mar.</hi> the Judgment was revived by <hi>Scire Facias</hi> brought by <hi>Howel, Gray,</hi> and <hi>Chaplain,</hi> Executors of Sir <hi>J. W. quoad omnia bona &amp; catalla ſua,</hi> except one Debt due by Bond from <hi>Henry Wakefield.</hi> And at the Return of the <hi>Scire Fac',</hi> the Defendant appears and demurs to the <hi>Scire Facias,</hi> and there is an Award of Execution, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon a Writ of Error is brought in the <hi>Exchequer Chamber,</hi> and the Judgment was affirmed. Then a Writ of Error is brought in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, and the General Error aſſigned.</p>
            <p>And here it was argued on the behalf of the Plaintiff in the Writ of Error, that this Action did not lye againſt him, becauſe it was brought againſt him for that which he did as a Judge, and ſo it appeared on the Record, according to 12 <hi>Rep.</hi> 25. that the Rule ſeems the ſame for one ſort of Judge, as well as for another; that this Perſon was lawfully made a Governour, and ſo had all the Powers of a Governour; that this was a Commitment only till he found Security, tho' not ſo Expreſſed; that this is not coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable here in <hi>Weſtminſter-hall;</hi> that he was only cenſurable by the King; that the Charge is ſufficient, in that Sir <hi>J. W.</hi> had not taken the Oaths; that <hi>male &amp; arbitrarie executus fuit,</hi> is Charge e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to warrant a Commitment; that this was a Charge before a Councel of State, and there need not be all the Matters pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely alledged to juſtifie their Acts; and by the ſame reaſon Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons may lye againſt the Privy Counſellors here, and enforce them to ſet forth every particular, which would be of dangerous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence; the Plea might have been much ſhorter, as only that he was committed by a Counſel of State, and the addition of the other Matters ſhall not hurt; and that the Charge was upon Oath ſhall be intended; no Preſumption ſhall be, that the Supream Magiſtracy there did irregularly; 'tis a power incident to every Council of State to be able to commit: This action cannot lye, becauſe the Fact is not triable here; the Laws there may be different from ours. Beſides no Action lies unlefs 'twere a malicious Commitment, as well as cauſeleſs: and that no Man will pretend that an Action can lye a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the chief Governour or Lieutenant of <hi>Ireland</hi> or <hi>Scotland,</hi> and by the ſame reaſon it ought not in this Caſe; he had a power to make Judges, and therefore he was more than a Judge; and they have confeſſed all this Matter by the Demurrer. The Statute of <hi>Car.</hi> 1. which reſtrains the power of our Councel of State, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:50172:21"/>that they could Commit; that in caſe of Crimes there they are puniſhable in that place; and in Sir <hi>Ellis Aſhburnham</hi>'s Caſe there was a Remanding to be tried there, and if ſo, it can't be examinable here; and if not, this Action will not lye. And fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that what was done here, was done in a Court; for ſo is a Councel of State to receive Complaints againſt State Delinquents, and to direct their Trials in proper Courts afterwards; that there was never ſuch an Action as this maintain'd; and if it ſhould, it would be impoſſible for a Governour to defend himſelf: Firſt, For that all the Records and Evidences are there. 2. The Laws there differ from what they are here; and Governments would be very weak, and the Perſons intruſted with them very uneaſie, if they are ſubject to be charged with Actions here for what they do in thoſe Countries, and therefore 'twas prayed that the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhould be reverſed.</p>
            <p>On the other ſide, 'twas argued for the Plaintiff in the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Action, That this Action did lye, and the Judgment on't was legal: That ſuppoſing the Fact done in <hi>England,</hi> the Plea of ſuch Authority ſo executed at <hi>Plymouth,</hi> or <hi>Portſmouth,</hi> or the like, had been ill; for that Liberty of Perſon by our Law is ſo ſacred, that every Reſtraint of it muſt be juſtified by ſome law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Authority, and that Authority muſt be expreſly purſued: That here was no Authority to commit; for that muſt be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as a Court of Record, or as Juſtices of Peace, Conſtable, or other Officer conſtituted for that purpoſe; that the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Patents are the only Juſtification inſiſted on, and that gives none; 'tis true, the power of Committing is incident to the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of a Court; here's only the Government of the Place com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to Sir <hi>Richard Dutton,</hi> with a power to erect Courts, and appoint Officers, but none to himſelf: He in Perſon is only au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized to manage and order the Affairs; and the Law of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> takes no notice of ſuch an Officer, or his Authority; and therefore a Court of Law can take notice of it, no further, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, then as it doth appear in pleading: The Councel is not conſtituted a Court; they are by the Letters Patents only to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe and aſſiſt the Governour; and the Governour hath no power to commit or puniſh, but to form and eſtabliſh Courts to do ſo; which imports the direct contrary, that he had no ſuch power: The Ends of appointing the Councel, as mentioned in the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Patents, are quite different, <hi>viz.</hi> to aid the Regent by their Advice, not to act as of themſelves; and if neither the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of himſelf, nor the Councel of it ſelf, had ſuch a power, neither can both together have it: A Court of Juſtice is not to be intended, unleſs the ſame be ſpecially ſhewn: Excepting the Caſe of the common known general Courts of Juſtice in <hi>Weſtminſter-hall,</hi> which are immemorial; if any thing be juſtified by the Authority of other Courts, the ſame muſt be preciſely alledged, and how their Commencement was, either by Cuſtom or Letters Patents: Here it appears by the Plea it ſelf, that they had Juſtices of <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> appointed: It doth not appear that he or the Councel were
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:50172:21"/>Judges of things of this kind. Beſides, when a Councel is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted, as here was Twelve by Name, that muſt be the Majority, as is the Dean and Chapter of <hi>Femes</hi> Caſe, <hi>Davis</hi>'s <hi>Rep.</hi> 47. and that's Seven at leaſt, which are not in this Caſe. There muſt be a Majority, unleſs the Erection did allow of a leſs Number. The practiſe of the Courts of <hi>Weſtminſter-hall</hi> do not contradict this, for there 'tis a Court, whether more or leſs, and ſo it hath been time out of Mind. But here's a new Conſtitution; and the Rule holds ſo in Commiſſions of <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Terminer,</hi> if the direction be ſo: as is the Caſe in <hi>Plowden</hi> 384. the Earl of <hi>Leiceſter</hi>'s Caſe. If a Mayor and three Aldermen have Conuſance of Pleas, what a Mayor and two does is null and void. And if there be no dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in particular for the number, the Law requires the majority. So that here was no Councel, becauſe but five of them preſent.</p>
            <p>The Councel have not the power, but the Governour with the Advice and Aſſent of the Councel; and ſo ought their pleading to have been according to their Caſe; That if a Man ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifies as a Judge to excuſe him from an Action, he muſt ſet forth his Authority, and the Cauſe muſt appear to be within his Conu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance; and ſo are multitudes of Caſes, 3 <hi>Cro.</hi> 130. 2 <hi>Leon. pl.</hi> 43. and 1 <hi>Cro.</hi> 153, 557, 579, 593. 12 <hi>Rep.</hi> 23, 25. <hi>Mod. Rep.</hi> 119.</p>
            <p>But taking it as a Councel, neither Perſon nor Thing are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in its Juriſdiction; for if their Doctrine be true, that by being Governour, he is ſo abſolute, as to be ſubject only to the King; then what Sir <hi>John Witham</hi> did, being while, and as Deputy Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, which is the true Governour to all purpoſes <hi>in abſentia</hi> of the other, is not examinable by a Succeſſor. But admitting for the preſent, that by the Law one Magiſtrate may be puniſhable be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Succeſſor for Miſcarriages which were committed <hi>colore Officii;</hi> yet here are no ſuch Miſcarriages ſufficiently alledged to be charged on him. 1. There's no pretence of an Oath, nor Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances ſhewing a reaſonable Cauſe of Suſpicion, one of which ought to have been. 2. In pleading no Allegation is ſufficient, if it be ſo general, as the Party opponent can't in reaſon be ſuppoſed ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of making an Anſwer to it; and that is the true Cauſe why our Law requires Certainty: He did <hi>male &amp; arbitrarie</hi> execute the Office to the Oppreſſion of the King's Subjects. No Man living can defend himſelf on ſo general a Charge as this is: for if Iſſue had been taken thereon, all the Acts of his Government had been examinable, which the Law never allows: Then the Particulars are as general; 1. That he did not take the uſual Oath; and it doth not appear what Oath, or if any was requirable of a Deputy Governour, nor who was to adminiſter it; ſo that <hi>non conſtat,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther 'twas his Fault or the Governours; beſides, that's no cauſe of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment, for any thing which appears in the Plea. 2. Aſſuming illegally the Title of Lieutanant Governour; that is ſo trivial, as it needs no Anſwer; for Deputy Governour and Lieutenant Governour are all one, <hi>locum tenens</hi> is a Deputy, <hi>&amp; è contra.</hi> 3. Altering of Orders at his Chamber <hi>ad libitum,</hi> which were made in Court; not ſaid that there was any ſuch Court, or what Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, or where made; <hi>&amp; non tantum</hi> without <hi>etiam</hi> or <hi>ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:50172:22"/>etiam,</hi> is not a ſufficient poſitive Allegation: not ſaid that he was guilty, but only charged; and not ſaid how charged, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with or without Oath, in writing or by parol: nor ſaid to be in any ſuch manner as that the Councel ought or might receive it: tho' <hi>Oath</hi> be not neceſſary to be mentioned in the Commitment, yet it ought to be alledged in pleading, becauſe 'tis neceſſary to warrant the Commitment, as was held in the Lord <hi>Yarmouth</hi>'s Caſe in <hi>B.R.</hi> It could not be to ſecure his anſwering the ſame, for not ſo expreſſed; and 'tis not ſaid that Sureties were demanded or denied, or that he had notice of the Charge; and ſurely this was bailable.</p>
            <p>As to the Query, If conuſable here; 'twas argued, That they had not pleaded to the <hi>Jur',</hi> nor any Matter to ouſt the Court of its <hi>Jur':</hi> If they intended by this Plea to have done that, they ſhould have given <hi>Jur'</hi> to ſome other Court in ſome other place, but this is not done; for if an Injury, 'tis relievable ſomewhere in the King's Dominions; and whether it be ſo, or not, is exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable ſomewhere: Now here is a Wrong complain'd of, as done by one Engliſh-man to another Engliſh-man, and a <hi>Jur'</hi> attacht in the <hi>King's Bench,</hi> both of Cauſe and Perſon, by the Bill filed, and his Defence to it: beſides <hi>Jur'</hi> could not be examined in the <hi>Exchequer Chamber,</hi> becauſe both the Statute and the Writ of Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror expreſly provide againſt it, and. this Writ of Error is founded upon that Affirmance, and therefore queſtionable, whether that could be inſiſted on here? But ſuppoſing it might, 'twas argued that the Action lies, for that 'tis a tranſitory Action, and follows the Perſon whereſoever he comes under the power of the Common Law Proceſs: and that a Man may as well be ſued in <hi>England</hi> for a Treſpaſs done beyond Sea, as in <hi>Barbadoes,</hi> or the like place; as for a Debt ariſing there by Specialty, or other Contract, that no Body but <hi>Prynne</hi> ever denied it, and he did ſo only in caſe of Bonds dated there: That many Actions have been maintained and tried here for Facts done in the <hi>Indies,</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding ſpecial Juſtifications to them, and the Trials have been where the Actions were laid: There was quoted <hi>Dowdale</hi>'s Caſe, 6 <hi>Rep.</hi> 47, 48. and 7 <hi>Rep.</hi> 27. and if otherwiſe, there would be a failure of Juſtice in the King's Dominions, 32 <hi>Hen.</hi> 6.25. <hi>vide Jackson</hi> and <hi>Criſpe</hi>'s Caſe, <hi>Sid.</hi> 462. 2 <hi>Keeble</hi> 391, 397.</p>
            <p>'Twas then argued, That whatſoever queſtion might be made about the Trial of the Iſſue, if one had been joyned; yet now Demurrer being to the Plea, if that Plea be naught, then the Plaintiff is to have Judgment upon his Declaration, and that is all right.</p>
            <p>It was further ſaid, That the Juſtification of ſuch a <hi>tort</hi> or wrong ought to be according to the Common Law of <hi>England,</hi> for that <hi>Barbadoes</hi> is under the ſame Law as <hi>England;</hi> and if 'twere not, upon his pleading it muſt be intended to be ſo; and tho' they ſhould be intended different, yet the Defendant in the Action was obliged to the ſame Rules of Pleading: for tho' the Matter may juſtifie him for an Act done there, which would not juſtifie him for the ſame Act done here, yet he muſt ſhew that he hath
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:50172:22"/>purſued the Rules of Law in that place; or in caſe of no po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive Laws, the Rules of Natural Equity: for either the Common Law, or new inſtituted Laws, or natural Equity, muſt be the Rule in thoſe places.</p>
            <p>'Twas agreed, That according to <hi>Calvin</hi>'s Caſe, 7 <hi>Rep.</hi> 17. upon the Conqueſt of an Infidel Country, all the old Laws are abroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>ex inſtanti,</hi> and the King impoſes what he pleaſes; and in caſe of the Conqueſt of a Chriſtian Country, he may change them at pleaſure, and appoint ſuch as he thinks fit; tho' <hi>Coke</hi> quotes no Authority for it, yet 'twas agreed, that this might be conſonant to reaſon. But 'twas denied that <hi>Barbadoes</hi> was a Conqueſt, 'twas a Colony or Plantation, and that imports rather the contrary; and by ſuch Names theſe Plantations have always gone in Letters Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, Proclamations, and Acts of Parliament. But whatſoever may by ſome be ſaid as to Statutes in particular binding there, the Common Law muſt and doth oblige there, for 'tis a Plantation or new Settlement of Engliſh-men by the King's Conſent in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inhabited Country; and ſo is the Hiſtory of <hi>Barbadoes</hi> written by <hi>Richard Ligon,</hi> Printed at <hi>London</hi> 1673. <hi>pag.</hi> 23. ſays he, 'Twas a Country not inhabited by any, but overgrown with Woods. And <hi>pag.</hi> 100. They are governed by the Laws of <hi>England.</hi> And <hi>Heylin</hi> in his <hi>Geography, lib.</hi> 4.148. ſays, The <hi>Engliſh</hi> are the ſole Colony there; they are called the King's Plantations, and not his Conqueſts; and he neither could, nor can now impoſe any Laws upon them different from the Laws of <hi>England.</hi> 'Twas ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued that even our Statutes do bind them; and many of them name theſe Plantations as <hi>Engliſh;</hi> they have ſome Municipal Rules there, like our By-laws in the <hi>Stanneries</hi> or <hi>Fenns;</hi> but that ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues nothing as to the general; which ſhall prevail when the one contradicts the other, may be a Query another time.</p>
            <p>By the 22 <hi>&amp;</hi> 23 <hi>Car.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 26. againſt the planting of Tobac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co here, and for the Regulation of the Plantation Trade, the Governours of thoſe Plantations are once a Year to return to the <hi>Cuſtom-houſe</hi> in <hi>London</hi> an Account of all Ships laden, and of all the Bonds, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And they are, throughout the whole Act, called the King's <hi>Engliſh</hi> Plantations, Governours of ſuch <hi>Engliſh</hi> Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, to ſome of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Plantations. And <hi>Paragr.</hi> 10. 'tis ſaid, Inaſmuch as the Plantations are inhabited which his Subjects of <hi>England;</hi> and ſo 'tis in 15 <hi>Car.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 7. <hi>ſect.</hi> 5. and in 12 <hi>Car.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 34. they are called Colonies and Plantations of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>England.</hi> From all which 'tis natural to infer, That the Rules in caſe of conquered Places cannot prevail here; Conqueſt <hi>eſt res odioſa,</hi> and never to be preſumed; beſides, 'tis the People, not the Soil, that can be ſaid to be conquered. The reaſon of a Conquerour's Power to preſcribe Laws, is the Conqueror's Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency in ſaving the Lives of the conquered, whom, by the ſtrict right of War, he might have deſtroyed; or the preſumed Chance of Subjection, which the conquered Prince and People threw themſelves upon, when they firſt engaged in the War. But this is not pretended to here, tho' all the Caſes about this Subject were
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:50172:23"/>put below ſtairs: Then taking it as the truth is, certain Subjects of <hi>England,</hi> by conſent of their Prince, go and poſſeſs an unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited deſert Country, the Common Law muſt be ſuppoſed their Rule, as 'twas their Birthright, and as 'tis the beſt, and ſo to be preſumed their Choice; and not only that, but even as obligatory, 'tis ſo. When they went thither, they no more abandoned the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Laws, then they did their Natural Allegiance; nay, they ſubjected themſelves no more to other Laws, than they did to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Allegiance, which they did not.</p>
            <p>This is a Dominion, belonging not only to the Crown, but to the Realm of <hi>England,</hi> tho' not within the Territorial Realm. <hi>Vaughan</hi> 330. ſays, That they follow <hi>England,</hi> and are a part of it. Then 'twas argued further, If 'twere poſſible that it ſhould be otherwiſe, when did the Common Law ceaſe? On the Sea it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in all Perſonal Reſpects; If Batteries or Wounds on Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board, Actions lay here: Then the ſame held when they landed there, and no new Laws could be made for them but by the Prince with their conſent.</p>
            <p>Beſides, Either the Right of theſe Lands was gained to the Crown, or to the Planters, by the Occupancy; and ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way the Common Law muſt be their Rule: It muſt be agreed, that the firſt Entry gained the right, and ſo is <hi>Grotius de jure Belli &amp; Pacis, lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 8. <hi>ſect.</hi> 6. and theſe Lands were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Kings, tho' they afterwards ſubmitted to take a Grant of the King. 'Tis true, in caſe of War, what is gained, becomes his who maintained the War, and doth not of right belong to that Perſon who firſt poſſeſſed it, <hi>Grot. lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 6. <hi>ſect.</hi> 11. But in caſe it be not the effect of War, but only by force of their firſt Entry, it muſt be conſidered what Intereſt they did acquire, and certainly 'twas the largeſt that can be; for an Occupant doth gain an Inheritance by the Law of Nations, and the ſame ſhall deſcend; then by the Rules of what Law ſhall the Deſcent be govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? it muſt be by the Laws of the Country to which they did originally, and ſtill do belong. But then ſuppoſing the Lands gained to the Crown, and the Crown to diſtribute theſe Lands, the Grant of them is to hold in Soccage, and that is a common Law Tenure; why are not their Perſons in like manner under the Common Law? When a Governour was firſt received by, or impoſed upon them, 'twas never intended, either by King or People, that he ſhould Rule by any other Law than that of <hi>England.</hi> And if it had been known to be otherwiſe, the number of Subjects there would have been very ſmall. In theſe Caſes their Allegiance continues, and muſt be according to the Laws of <hi>England;</hi> and 'twas argued, that <hi>ex conſequenti</hi> the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection and rule of them ought to be by the ſame Laws, for they are mutual and reciprocal, <hi>unum trahit alterum;</hi> and that Law which is the Rule of the one, ſhould be the Rule of the other; beſides, 'tis the Inhabitants, not the Country, that are capable of Laws, and thoſe are <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and ſo declared and allowed to be; and conſequently there's no reaſon why the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Laws ſhould
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:50172:23"/>not follow the Perſons of Engliſh-men, eſpecially while they are under the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Government, and ſince the Great Seal goes thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And further, a Writ of Error lies here upon any of their ultimate Judgments; ſo ſays <hi>Vaughan</hi> 402. and 21 <hi>Hen.</hi> 7.3. that it doth ſo to all Subordinate Dominions; and tho' the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Place prevents the common uſe of ſuch Writ, yet by his Opinion it clearly lies; and he reckons the Plantations part of thoſe Subordinate Dominions. Now a Writ of Error is a remedial Writ, whereon Right is to be done, and that muſt be according to the Laws of <hi>England;</hi> for the <hi>King's Bench,</hi> in caſe of a Reverſal upon ſuch Writ, is to give a new Judgment, as by Law ought to have been firſt given. <hi>Vaughan</hi> 290, 291, ſays, It lies at Common Law to reverſe Judgments in any inferiour Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions; for if it did not, inferiour and Provincial Governments might make what Laws they pleaſe; for Judgments are Laws when they are not to be reverſed. It lay to <hi>Ireland</hi> by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law, ſays <hi>Coke</hi> 7 <hi>Rep.</hi> 18. tho' there had been no Reſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it in King <hi>John</hi>'s Charter. Then 'twas inferred, that the lying of a Writ of Error proves the Laws to be the ſame, <hi>i.e.</hi> in general the Common Law to govern in both places, from the difference aſſigned between <hi>Ireland</hi> and <hi>Scotland;</hi> it lies not to <hi>Scotland,</hi> becauſe a diſtinct Kingdom, and governed by diſtinct Laws; and it lies to <hi>Ireland,</hi> becauſe ruled by the ſame, and conſequently if a Writ of Error lies on the final Judgment there; it's a good Argument that the ſame Law prevails there. Theſe Plantations are parcel of the Realm, as Counties Palatine are: Their Rights and Intereſts are every day determined in <hi>Chancery</hi> here, only that for neceſſity and encouragement of Trade and Commerce, they make Plantation-Lands as Aſſets in certain Caſes to pay Debts; in all other things they make Rules for them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the common Courſe of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Equity: The diſtance, or the contiguity of the thing, makes no alteration in the Caſe. And then 'twas ſaid, as at firſt, That this then was the ſame caſe, as if the Impriſonment had been in <hi>England</hi> or on Shipboard, as to the Rules of Juſtification; that if there were another Law, which could juſtifie it, the ſame ought to have been certainly pleaded.</p>
            <p>As to the Inſtructions, thoſe do not appear, and therefore are not to be conſidered in the Caſe, and they ſhould have been ſet forth, and no extraordinary Power is to be preſumed, unleſs ſhewn, for every Man in pleading is thought to make the beſt of his own Caſe, and conſequently that if 'twould have made for him, the ſame would have been ſhewn; and becauſe they are not ſhewn, they muſt be thought directive of a Government according to the Laws of <hi>England,</hi> ſince 'tis to a Subject of this Realm to govern other Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of this Realm, living upon a part of this Realm, and from the King thereof, who muſt be ſuppoſed to approve thoſe Laws which make him King, and by which he reigns.</p>
            <pb n="34" facs="tcp:50172:24"/>
            <p>Then 'twas argued, Suppoſe this Governour had borrowed Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney of a Man in the Iſland, and then had returned to <hi>England,</hi> and an Action had been brought for it, and he had pretended to uſtifie the receipt of it as Governour; he muſt have ſhewn his Power, the Law, and how he obſerved that Law; the like for Goods; the ſame reaſon for Torts and Wrongs done <hi>vi &amp; ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the Court below could conſider no other Power or Law to juſtifie this act, but the Common Law of <hi>England,</hi> and that will not do it for the Reaſons given; and if it be juſtifiable by any other, it muſt be pleaded; and what he hath pleaded is not pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to the Commitment by a Council of State, what it means is hardly known in the Law of <hi>England;</hi> and that Authority which commits by our Law, ought to be certain, and the Cauſe expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, as all the Arguments upon the Writ of <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> in old time do ſhew; but here's no Councel: and 'tis not ſaid ſo much, as that he was <hi>debito modo onerat':</hi> And as to the Demurr', that confeſſes no more then what is well pleaded: And as to Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, there's more danger to the Liberty of the Subject, by al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing ſuch a Behaviour, then can be to the Government by al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the Action to lye: And therefore 'twas prayed that the Judgment might be affirmed.</p>
            <p>It was replyed on behalf of the Plaintiff in the Writ of Error, That notwithſtanding all that had been ſaid, the Laws there were different, tho' the Foundation of them was the Common Law that they would not enter into that Queſtion, What ſort of Title at firſt gave Right to theſe Lands? but that this was a Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by a Councel of State: And, as to the Objection of too general Pleadings <hi>in male &amp; arbitrarie exercendo, &amp;c.</hi> tho' the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducement of the Plea was ſo. There were other Matters more particularly pleaded; the altering the Decrees in his Chamber, which was ſufficient: And as to the Objection, That 'tis not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged in the Pleadings, that the Charge in Councel againſt <hi>Wy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tham</hi> was upon Oath; they anſwered, That 'tis not effential, tho' prudent, to have the Charge upon Oath before Commitment; Matters may be otherwiſe apparent. And as to the Objection, That the Warrant of the Councel for the Commitment was not ſhewn; they ſaid that it lay not in their power, becauſe 'twas delivered to the Provoſt Marſhal, as his Authority, for the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Detention of him, and therefore did belong to him to keep: And that the Councel, tho' they were not a Court, yet they had Juriſdiction to hear the Complaint, and ſend him to another Court that could try the Crime; and tho' it did not appear that the King gave any Authority to the Governour and Councel to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, yet 'tis incident to their Authority, as being a Councel of State; the Councel here in <hi>England</hi> commit no otherwiſe: and where the Commitment is not authorized by Law, the King's Patent gives no power for it: But the Government muſt be very weak, where the Councel of State cannot commit a Delinquent, ſo as to be forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:50172:24"/>to another Court that can puniſh his Delinquency: And therefore prayed that the Judgment ſhould be reverſed, and the ſame was accordingly reverſed.</p>

            <p>Then they find that the 16th of <hi>May,</hi> the Biſhop iſſued his Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to the Rector, or Sub-Rector, for a General Viſitation, to be held the 16th of <hi>June,</hi> in the Chappel of the Colledge; and accordingly the 16th of <hi>June,</hi> the Biſhop comes to the Colledge, and to the Door of the Chappel, which was ſhut up; and that the Porter was ſubject to the Government of the Rector, and bound to obey his Commands, in ſhutting or opening the Doors; and certain of the Scholars did then offer <hi>in area Collegij,</hi> a certain Writing under their Hands, proteſting againſt the Viſitation, as within time, by reaſon of Dr. <hi>Maſters</hi>'s Viſitation: This is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed by the Biſhop: The Biſhop then Adminiſtred an Oath to <hi>Webber,</hi> of the Service of Citation; and then he called over the Names of the Rector and Scholars who appeared not; and not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing admitted into the Chappel, he departed.</p>

And they find further, That the Four Fellows which Subſcribed the Sentence of Deprivation, were not of the Senior Fellows, unleſs by the Deprivation of Dr. <hi>Herne,</hi> and the Suſpenſion of <hi>George Vernon, Thomas Leth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge, Benjamin Archer, Samuel Adams,</hi> and <hi>Philip Thorne;</hi> all which ſix, half the number of the Suſpended, were Seniors to the Conſenting Scholars.</p>

            </p>
            <p>That <hi>William Painter</hi> as Rector, and the Scholars of the ſaid Colledge did make the Demiſe in the Declaration, and thereon the Plaintiff entred, and Dr. <hi>Bury</hi> enters on him, and holds, and yet doth hold him out, <hi>modo &amp; forma prout in nar',</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ſed utrum ſuper totam materiam praedict' locus Rectoris per privation' praedictam praed' Arthuri legitime vacavit nec ne</hi> the Jury are ignorant, <hi>&amp; ſi per inde locus praedict' legitime vacavit tunc pro quaerent' &amp; ſi non, tunc pro Defendent'.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was argued on the behalf of the Plaintiff in the Writ of Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, That this Judgment was illegal; and the general Queſtion was, Whether this Sentence of Deprivation, thus given by the Viſitor againſt Dr. <hi>Bury,</hi> did make the Rectorſhip void as to him, and ſo conſequently gave a Title to the Leſſor of the Plaintiff. But upon this Record the Queſtions were two: 1. Whether or no by the Conſtitution of this Colledge, the Biſhop had a Power in this Caſe to give a Sentence. 2. Suppoſing that he had ſuch a Power, Whether the Juſtice of that Sentence were examinable in <hi>Weſtminſter-hall</hi> upon that Action?</p>
            <p>And 1. 'twas argued, That the Biſhop had ſuch a Power to give a Sentence; and it was agreed that he could make his Viſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion but once in five Years, unleſs he be called by the Requeſt of the Colledge; and if he comes uncalled within the five Years, his Viſitation would be void: But yet the Viſitation of the 24th of <hi>July</hi> was a good Viſitation, and conſequently the Sentence upon it is good; that there was no colour to make Dr. <hi>Maſters</hi>'s coming in <hi>March</hi> to examine <hi>Colmer</hi>'s Appeal upon the Viſitor's Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, to be a Viſitation; and that becauſe it was a Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon a particular Complaint, made by a ſingle expelled Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, for a particular Wrong and Injury ſuppoſed to be done to him, and not a general Authority to exerciſe the Viſitatorial Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, which is to inquire into all Abuſes, <hi>&amp;c. Colmer</hi> complains that he was expelled without juſt Cauſe, and ſeeks to the Viſitor, for redreſs, they having expelled him for an Offence, of which he thought himſelf innocent; and the Viſitor ſends his Commiſſary to examine this particular matter. Then 'twas urged, That tho' a Viſitor be reſtrained by the Conſtitutions of the Colledge, from viſiting <hi>ex officio,</hi> but once in five Years; yet as a Viſitor, he had a conſtant ſtanding Authority at all times to hear the Complaints, and redreſs the Grievances of the particular Members; and that is part of the proper Office of a Viſitor to determine particular Differences between the Members, and thus is <hi>Littleton</hi>'s <hi>Text, ſect.</hi> 136. that complaint may be made to the Ordinary or Viſitor, praying him that he will lay ſome Correction and Puniſhment for
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:50172:28"/>the ſame, and that ſuch Default be no more made, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And the Ordinary or Viſitor of right ought to do this, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſo was it held in <hi>Appleford</hi>'s Caſe in the Court of <hi>King's Bench,</hi> who was expelled upon a like occaſion as <hi>Colmer</hi> was; he appealed to the Biſhop of <hi>Winton,</hi> who was Viſitor, and he confirmed the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion, and held to be good upon the Appeal; for the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Appeals is a ſtanding, fixed, conſtant Juriſdiction. Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiting is one Act or Exerciſe of his Power, in which he is limited as to time; but redreſſing of Grievances is another, and his proper Office and Buſineſs at all times. 'Tis the Caſe of all the Biſhops of <hi>England,</hi> they can viſit by Law but once in three years, but their Courts are always open to hear Complaints and Determine Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals; ſo that here, tho' but one Viſitation can be in five years without requeſt, yet the Power and Authority to hear and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine any difference between the Members, and to relieve a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt any particular Injury, that's continual, and not limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
            <p>Then 'twas argued, That tho' what was done upon the 16th of <hi>June,</hi> was with an Intention to Viſit, yet being denied to enter the Chappel, where the Viſitation was appointed to be held, it was none; and his Calling over the Names, was only to know who hindred the Viſiting; and his making an Act of it afterwards, or adminiſtring an Oath at the time, can never be called one; tho' it hath been below ſaid to be a tacking that of <hi>June</hi> to that of <hi>July:</hi> but that cannot be, for then it continued much longer than was intended; nay, much longer then it can by the Statutes of the Colledge, for that is to ceaſe in three days.</p>
            <p>It turns rather the other way; having been hindred in <hi>June,</hi> he makes an Act of it in <hi>July,</hi> in order to call them to an account for it, as for a Conturnacy, and to bring them to Judgment at his Viſitation: 'Twas no more then taking an Affidavit of the Service of a Citation.</p>
            <p>The appointment of a Viſitation in the Hall was occaſioned by the Obſtruction met with at the Chappel; and 'twould be a very ſtrange Conſtruction, that when he deſigned a Viſitation, and was hindred, that the Hinderance and his Inquiry about it ſhould be called a Viſitation; and a former Contumacy in oppoſing an intended Viſitation, ſhould prevent their being ſubject to an actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al true one.</p>
            <p>Then 'twas argued, That there was no neceſſity that there ſhould be the Conſent of the four Senior Fellows to the Depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Rector; and by one of the Counſel 'twas owned, that if ſuch Conſent had been neceſſary, the Sentence had been a Nullity: But as this Statute is framed, 'twas argued, that the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop might deprive tho' they did not concur, for theſe Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons:</p>
            <p n="1">1. By the Statutes, the Biſhop for the time being, is made the ordinary Viſitor of <hi>Exeter</hi> Colledge, and that where any one is Viſitor of a Colledge, he hath full and ample Authority to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:50172:29"/>or Amove any Member of the Colledge <hi>quatenus</hi> Viſitor. 2. There is an expreſs Power given to the Biſhop to proceed to the Deprivation of the Rector, or the Expulſion of a Scholar; and this in his Viſitation. And 3. The qualifying words do not reſtrain it to be with the Conſent of the four Fellows; the word is <hi>Deprivatio</hi> as to the Rector, and <hi>Expulſio</hi> as to the Scholar; tho' they are ſynonymous as to real Senſe, yet by this Statute they are differently applied: Then it ſays, <hi>If the Biſhop do proceed,</hi> &amp;c. that only relates to the Caſe of a Scholar, becauſe the word there uſed is <hi>Expulſio,</hi> which is never applied but to the amotion of a Scholar; and it is impoſſible to relate to the Rector, for then he muſt conſent to his own Deprivation, for his particular Conſent is mentioned and required, and that is not to be expected: And in this caſe, the Conſent of the Senior Fellows, without that of the Rector, is not ſufficient.</p>
            <p>But then the ſubſequent words are, <hi>That if the Rector be depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the Biſhop's Commiſſary, with the Conſent of the Senior Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, he may appeal to the Biſhop:</hi> 'Tis true, the Rector hath that liberty, if the Commiſſary do deprive him; but there are no words that do abridge the Biſhop's own Power. The Commiſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry's Power is reſtrained by thoſe words, <hi>To have the Conſent,</hi> &amp;c. but the Biſhop's own Power hath no ſuch qualification.</p>
            <p>It is objected, That 'tis unreaſonable to imagine a greater Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in the Viſitor, over the Rector, then over the Scholars. But the Queſtion is not, What was fit and reaſonable for the Founder to have done; but to conſider, upon peruſal of the Statutes, what he hath done? Suppoſe he doth give ſuch an abſolute Authority, 'tis what he had over the thing granted; he might have reſerved to himſelf a Power of Revocation, or what other Power he thought fit; and by the ſame reaſon he might give the like to a Viſitor of his appointment; and having done ſo, it muſt be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed that he had ſome Reaſons for ſo doing. The Rector hath a Priviledge, not to be deprived without the benefit of Appeal, if 'twere by the Commiſſary: The Scholars have no Appeal. He might think fit to truſt the Rector with his Viſitor the Biſhop, as ſuppoſing more care would be taken by him of the Head of the Colledge, then of Inferiour Members.</p>
            <p>But the Query is not, What Reaſon induced the Founder to make thoſe Appointments? He was Maſter of his own Charity, and might qualifie it as he pleaſed; and he hath given it under this qualification, That the Biſhop is made Viſitor, and might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive the Rector, as he hath done, according to the Statutes and Conſtitutions of this Colledge.</p>
            <p>Then 2. the ſufficiency of the Cauſe of this Deprivation is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to be called in queſtion, nor any Inquiry to be made in <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter-hall</hi> into the Reaſons or Cauſes of ſuch Deprivation, if the Sentence be given by him that is the proper Viſitor, created ſo by the Founder, or by the Law.</p>
            <pb n="45" facs="tcp:50172:29"/>
            <p>'Twas urged, That there are in Law two ſorts of Corporations aggregate, conſiſting of many Perſons; ſuch as are for Publick Government, and ſuch as are for Private Charity. Thoſe that are for Publick Government of a City, Town, Myſtery, or the like, being of Publick Concern, are to be governed according to the Laws of the Land, and to be regulated and reformed by the Juſtice of <hi>Weſtminſter-hall;</hi> of theſe there are no private Founders, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently no particular Viſitors: There are no Patrons of theſe; they only ſubſiſt by virtue of the King's Letters Patents, or Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom and Uſage, which ſuppoſes Letters Patents, and are ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported and ruled by the Methods of Law: Therefore, if a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration be made for the Publick Government of a Town or Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and there is no Proviſion in the Charter how the Succeſſion ſhall be, the Law ſupplies the Defect of that Conſtitution, and ſays it ſhall be by Election, as Mayor, Aldermen, and Common-Council-men, and the like; and ſo is 1 <hi>Rolls Abridg.</hi> 513.</p>
            <p>But private and particular Corporations for Charity, Founded and Endowed by private perſons, are ſubject to the particular Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of thoſe who Erect them: therefore, if there be no vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitor appointed; in all ſuch caſes of Elemoſmary Corporations, the Law doth appoint the Founder and his Heirs to be Viſitors: They are Patrons, and not to be guided by the common known Laws and Rules of the Kingdom; but ſuch Corporations are as to their own Affairs to be governed by the particular Laws and conſtitutions aſſigned them by the Founder.</p>
            <p>Though ſome have ſaid, that the Common-Law doth not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point any Viſitation or Viſitor at all; yet 'tis plain, that it doth in defect of a particular appointment; it makes the Founder Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitor; and it is not at his pleaſure whether there ſhall be a Viſitor or not, but if he is ſilent during his Life-time, the right will deſcend to his Heirs, and ſo is <hi>Yelv. &amp;</hi> 2 <hi>Cro.</hi> where it is admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on all hands, that the Founder is Patron, and as Patron, is Viſitor, if no particular Viſitor be aſſigned, 8. <hi>Edw.</hi> 7, 8. 8 <hi>Aſſis'</hi> 29.9 <hi>Hen.</hi> 6.33. 1 <hi>Inſt.</hi> 96. ſo that Patronage and Viſitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, are neceſſary conſequents, one upon another; for this Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatorial Power was not introduced by any Canons or Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons Eccleſiaſtical, it is an appointment of the Law; it ariſeth from the property which the Founder had in the Lands aſſigned to ſupport the Charity: And as he is the Author of the Charity, the Law gives him and his Heirs a Viſitatorial Power, <hi>i.e.</hi> an Authority to inſpect their Actions, and regulate their Behaviour as he pleaſeth: For it is not fit, that the Members who are indowed, and that have the Charity beſtowed upon them, ſhould be left to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but they ought to purſue the intent and deſigns of him that beſtowed it upon them.</p>
            <p>Where the Poor are not incorporated, <hi>i.e.</hi> they who are to have the Charity, but Truſtees are appointed, there is no Viſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torial Power, becauſe the intereſt of the Revenue is not veſted in them; but when they who are to enjoy the benefit of the Gift are incorporated, there to prevent all perverting of the Charity, there
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:50172:30"/>the Law doth not eſtabliſh a Viſitatorial Power: and it being a Creature of the Founders, 'tis reaſonable that he and his Heirs ſhould have that Power, unleſs it were devolved elſewhere.</p>
            <p>'Twas further argued, that in our Old Books deprived by Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron, and deprived by Viſitor are all one, for this Authority to viſit is a benefit that naturally ſprings out of the Foundation, and it was in his power, if he pleaſed, to transfer it to another, and where he hath done ſo, the other will have the ſame right and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority as the Founder had.</p>
            <p>There's no manner of difference between an Hoſpital and a College, except only in degree; An Hoſpital is for thoſe that are poor and mean, or Sick, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> a College is for another ſort of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and to another intent, the former is to maintain and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port them, this is to Educate them in Learning, that have not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe wherewithal to do it: But ſtill it is much within the ſame reaſon of that of an Hoſpital; and if in an Hoſpital, the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter and Poor are incorporated; 'tis a College having a common Seal to act by, though it bears not that name, becauſe it is of an inferiour degree; and in both caſes there muſt be a Viſitor, as both are Elemoſinary.</p>
            <p>A Viſitor being then of neceſſity created by the Law, (as 8 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3.69, 70. Every Hoſpital is viſitable, if lay by the Patron, if Spiritual by the Ordinary,) he is to Judge, and he may Expel; and as it is 8 <hi>Aſſis'</hi> 29, 30. he may deprive; the only Query is, if he were Viſitor at this time, for it hath been and muſt be agreed on all hands, that <hi>Quatenus Viſitor,</hi> he might deprive; if he be a Viſitor as Ordinary, there lieth an Appeal from his deprivation, but if as Patron, there's none; and then that deprivation, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther right or not, muſt ſtand.</p>
            <p>As to the Objection, that 'tis not the Sentence of a Court, and therefore not Concluſive; 'tis not material whether it be a Court or not, but the Query is, if he had juriſdiction and conu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance of the Perſon and thing, and if he had, then his ſentence holds: and where the Founder hath not thought fit to direct an Appeal, no appeal lies, nay not to the Common-Law Courts: the Founder having put all under the Judgment of the Viſitor, it muſt continue ſo: He might have ordered it, that the Rector ſhould continue only during the pleaſure of the Viſitor, but now he hath left it to his wiſdom according to the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes.</p>
            <p>He is a Judge not only in particular by appointment, but as he is Conſtituted a Viſitor in general; then in pleading of a Sentence of deprivation, there is no neceſſity of ſhewing the cauſe, the cauſe is not traverſable even in a Viſitation, ſo is <hi>Raſtal.</hi> 1.11 <hi>Hen.</hi> 7.27. 7 <hi>Rep. Kenne</hi>'s Caſe. 9 <hi>Edw.</hi> 4.24.</p>
            <p>Suppoſe this Rectory had been a ſole Corporation, and not part of a Corporation aggregate, as it is, Conſiſting of Rector and Scholars, and Dr. <hi>Bury</hi> had brought an aſſize, and this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>privation had been pleaded, it had been good to have ſaid that the <hi>Viſitor certis de Cauſis ipſum adinde moventibus,</hi> had deprived
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:50172:30"/>him: every thing that is traverſable muſt be expreſſed with cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, but the cauſe need not be ſo in this Caſe.</p>
            <p>Now 'tis ſtrange, that pleading a Sentence without a Cauſe, ſhould be good, and the finding of a Sentence in like manner in a ſpecial verdict ſhould not be good: If in Pleading it be not traverſable, 'tis the ſtrongeſt Argument, that the Cauſe is not to be inquired into; the having no Appeal doth not leſſen the validity of the Sentence, it doth only ſhew the Rector's place, not to be ſo certain and durable, as in other caſes they are, where Appeals are allowed.</p>
            <p>The Caſe of <hi>Caudrys,</hi> in the High Commiſſion Court, is as ſtrong; a Sentence of deprivation, no Appeals, and the Sentence found and no cauſe ſhewn, yet held good: 'tis no Anſwer to ſay, that that was by the Eccleſiaſtical Law, how is it the Eccleſiaſtical Law, that a Man ſhall be concluded by one Sentence without Appeal; no, it was, becauſe 'twas by a Court that had <hi>Jur'</hi> and the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence was not the weaker, or the cauſe of it more inquirable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there's no Appeal.</p>
            <p>'Twas by the Eccleſiaſtical Conſtitution, that the Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners had that Power, but that was eſtabliſhed by the Law of the Land, and ſo is the Viſitatorial Power, the one Authority is as much derived from the Law as the other.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bird</hi> and <hi>Smith</hi>'s Caſe in <hi>Moore</hi>'s <hi>Rep.</hi> deprivation for not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming to the Canons; held good in like manner.</p>
            <p>As to the Caſe of <hi>Coueney</hi> in <hi>Dyer.</hi> 209. and that in <hi>Bagges</hi>'s Caſe, 11 <hi>Rep.</hi> 99. they are the ſame as to this matter, though in Two Books, an aſſize becauſe no Appeal; he quotes Books for it, but upon a peruſal they will not warrant the diſtinction, for the party is as much concluded in the one Caſe as in the other: 'tis reaſonable to ſuſpect that Caſe not to be Law, becauſe that is impracticable, which it is brought to prove. The Head of a College cannot maintain an Aſſize for his Office of Headſhip: He hath not ſuch an Eſtate as will maintain that writ, therefore to give that inſtance againſt us, is hard, the Rector hath no ſuch ſole Sezin, the whole body of the College have an intereſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in: He hath no Title to the Money in his own Right, till by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent they are diſtributed, and after ſuch diſtribution, 'tis not the Rector's Money, but Dr. <hi>Bury</hi>'s; He is the only viſible head of the Body in deed, but has no ſingle right.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Appleford</hi>'s Caſe, the like Argument was drawn from this Caſe for a <hi>Mandamus,</hi> and inſiſted that he might have an aſſize, but ſaid by the Lord <hi>Hales,</hi> that that was impoſſible: and in truth, there's no difference between this Caſe and that of a <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damus,</hi> there was a return that he was removed, <hi>pro crimine en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ormi,</hi> and Appealed to the Biſhop of <hi>Winton,</hi> who confirmed the amotion, and the particular cauſe was not at all returned, and held good, becauſe there was a local Viſitor, who had given a Sentence, and all parties were concluded by it, the ſame being done by the Power of that Government, which the Founder had thought ſit to put them under.</p>
            <pb n="48" facs="tcp:50172:31"/>
            <p>Now 'twas argued from hence, That this was an expreſs Caſe, If the Cauſe of the Deprivation be examinable in the Courts of Common Law, why not upon a <hi>Mandamus</hi> as well as in an Eject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The Lord <hi>Hales</hi> in that Caſe of <hi>Appleford,</hi> took it for clear Law, That the Sentence was as binding as a Judgment in an Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſize: He is made a Judge, and his Perſon particularly deſigned by the Founder, but he hath his Authority from the Law; and ſince the Founder hath truſted the Matter to his Diſcretion, 'tis not to be ſuſpected that he hath done, or will do otherwiſe than right.</p>
            <p>Then in the next place 'twas argued, That there doth not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear any Injuſtice in the Sentence, and conſequently it ought to be preſumed Juſt; Credence is to be given to a Perſon that exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſeth Judicial Power, if he keep within his Juriſdiction. The Law hath reſpect not only to Courts of Record, and Judicial Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings in them; but even to all other Proceedings, where the Perſon that gives his Judgment or Sentence, hath a Judicial Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; and here's no Fault found in the Sentence; the Jury have not ſo much as found the Matter and Ground of it to be untrue in Fact, or inſufficient in Law.</p>
            <p>Then 'twas urg'd, That the Cauſe of Deprivation here was juſt, it being for Contumacy. If the Biſhop had power to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit in <hi>June,</hi> as he had, and was hindred by their ſhutting the Doors, whereupon he went away without doing any thing, and came again in <hi>July,</hi> when he held his Viſitation, and they behaved themſelves Contumaciouſly, and refuſed to ſubmit to his Authority; this was <hi>contra officii ſui debitum;</hi> 'tis reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able that both Head and Members ſhould ſubmit to the Viſitor; Contumacy is a good Cauſe of Deprivation, and upon good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, becauſe it hinders an Inquiry into all other Cauſes: 'Twas held ſo in <hi>Bird</hi> and <hi>Smith</hi>'s Caſe, and in <hi>Allen</hi> and <hi>Naſh</hi>'s Caſe; <hi>quia fuit refractarius:</hi> Now tho' Contumacy be not one of the Cauſes mentioned in the Statutes, yet 'twas certainly contrary to their Duty; turning their Backs upon the Viſitor, not appearing upon Summons, refuſing to be examined, was an Offence, and contrary to what the Statutes require. He is to inſpect the ſtate of the Colledge, and each Member's particular behaviour; and now when the Viſitor comes to make ſuch an Inquiſition, and the Head or the Members withdraw themſelves, and will not appear to be examined, if this be not a good Cauſe of Deprivation, nothing can be, for that nothing elſe can ever be inquired into.</p>
            <p>As for that Statute which refers to the Cauſes for which a Rector may be deprived, it doth not relate to a Deprivation in a Viſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but ſhews the manner, how the Colledge is to proceed, if he be guilty of ſuch Offences; they may complain at any time to the Viſitor, if he waſts the Revenues, or behave himſelf ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly, and upon requeſt will not reſign, and they may Article againſt him out of a Viſitation; but when he comes to execute his Power in his quinquennial Viſitation, he is not confined to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:50172:31"/>only upon the Information of the Fellows, but is to inquire into all the Affairs of the Colledge, and may proceed to depriva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as he ſees Cauſe. Now Contumacy is a <hi>cauſa</hi> of a Forfeiture of his Office, which is ſubject to the power of the Viſitor by the original Rules of the Foundation; and to evade or contumaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly to refuſe or deny a Submiſſion to that Power, is an Offence againſt the Duty of his Place, and conſequently a juſt Cauſe of Deprivation; ſo that upon the whole Matter, 'twas inferred and urged, that the Biſhop hath a Viſitatorial Power veſted in him to deprive the Rector without conſent of the four Senior Fellows. And 2. that the Juſtice of the Sentence is not examinable in <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter-hall.</hi> And 3. that if it were, and the Cauſe neceſſary to be ſhewn, here was a good one, an affronting the very Power of Viſiting, and fetting up for Independency, contrary to the Will of the Founder; and therefore it was prayed that the Judgment ſhould be reverſed.</p>
            <p>On the other ſide, 'twas argued by the Counſel with the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, That this Sentence was void; that 'twas a meer Nullity; that this proceeding had no Authority to warrant it; and that it being done without Authority, 'tis as if done by a meer Stranger; and whether it be ſuch an Act, or not, is examinable at Law; for that the Power of a Viſitor muſt be conſidered, as a meer Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority or a Truſt, and it is one, or rather both, and then either way 'tis examinable; for every Authority or Truſt hath, or ought to have, ſome Foundation to warrant it; and if that Foundation which warrants it, hath limited any Rules or Directions, by which it is to be executed, then thoſe Directions ought to be purſued; and if they are not, 'tis no Execution of the Authority given, or Truſt repoſed; and if not, 'tis a void Act, a meer Nullity, and conſequently 'tis that of which every Man may take notice and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.</p>
            <p>Then 'twas ſaid, That it muſt be agreed that of a void thing all Perſons may take advantage, and conteſt it in a Collateral Action, and that altho' it have the form and ſemblance of a Judicial Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding: and for this was cited the Caſe of the <hi>Marſhalſea</hi>'s, 10 <hi>Rep.</hi> 76. as a full Authority; the Reſolution was, That when a Court hath no Juriſdiction of a Cauſe, there all the proceeding is <hi>coram non judice,</hi> and Actions lye againſt any Perſon pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to do an Act by colour of ſuch Precept or Proceſs, without any regard to its being a Precept or Proceſs; and therefore the Rule, <hi>qui juſſu judicis aliquid fecerit, non videtur dolo malo feciſſe, quia parere neceſſe est,</hi> will not hold, where there is no <hi>judex,</hi> for 'tis not of neceſſity to obey him who is not Judge of the Cauſe; and therefore the Rule on the other ſide is true, <hi>judicium a non ſuo judice datum, nullius est momenti;</hi> and ſo was it held in the Caſe of <hi>Bowſer</hi> and <hi>Collins,</hi> 22 <hi>Edw.</hi> 4.33. <hi>per Pigot,</hi> and 19 <hi>Edw.</hi> 4.8. And therefore if the Court of <hi>Common Bench</hi> held Plea of an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal of Felony, 'tis all void; but it muſt be owned, that the meer erroneous procedure of a Court which hath a General Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:50172:32"/>of the Subject Matter is not examinable in a Collateral A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, whether upon true Grounds, or not; and yet if it be a limited Juriſdiction, and thoſe limits are not obſerved, even that is <hi>coram non judice;</hi> and holds with reſpect to Courts held by Authority of Law, which are much ſtronger then the Caſes of Power created or given by a private Perſon. A Sheriff is bound by Law to hold his turn within a Month after <hi>Michaelmas,</hi> and he holds it after the Month, and takes a Preſentment at that time, if that be removed into the <hi>King's Bench,</hi> the Party ſhall not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer it, but be diſcharged, becauſe the Preſentment was void, <hi>&amp; coram non judice;</hi> for that the Sheriff at that time had no Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; and yet in that Caſe his Authority and Juriſdiction extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Perſon and Thing: The ſame Law for a Leet, unleſs Cuſtom warrants the contrary, and then that Cuſtom muſt be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued.</p>
            <p>The Commiſſioners of Sewers have a limited Authority; and if the number of Perſons, or other Requiſites mentioned in their Commiſſion, be not purſued, what they do which exceeds it, is void; and yet they have a kind of Legiſlative Authority; ſo is it in Sir <hi>Henry Mildmay</hi>'s Caſe, 2 <hi>Cro.</hi> 336. and there they had an Authority both of Thing and Perſon, but did not obſerve the Rules preſcribed in the Gift of that Authority, according to the 23 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 5. and no reaſon could, or can be given for that Reſolution, but that it was a particular limited Authority: And then, to apply this to the preſent Caſe, the Sentence in queſtion can no more aggrieve the Defendant, then an Order pronounced or made by a <hi>non Judex,</hi> if it be not agreeable to the Power given by the Statutes; and this appears further from <hi>Davis</hi>'s <hi>Rep.</hi> 46. where the ſame Diſtinction is allowed.</p>
            <p>Nay, in ſome Caſes, the Award of a wrong Proceſs is void; as if by a Steward of a Mannor Court, that a <hi>Capias</hi> ſhould iſſue, where the ſame doth not lye, but only an Attachment, <hi>Turville</hi> and <hi>Tipper</hi>'s Caſe, <hi>Latch.</hi> 223. A Court of Pypowders hath Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of an Action of the Caſe; yet if it holds Plea of Caſe for Slander, 'tis all void, tho' the words were ſpoken within the Boundaries of the Fair, becauſe the Juriſdiction is limited; ſo that if the Thing, the Time, the Perſon, or the Proceſs, be not regarded according to the Authority given, 'tis all void, and an Advantage may be taken of it by any Body, where the Plaintiff Claims or makes his Demand by colour of ſuch Act.</p>
            <p>'Twas further argued, That the Reaſon given in that Caſe of <hi>Latch,</hi> is, becauſe the Cuſtom which gave him his Authority, gave him notice that ſuch Proceſs did not lye; and if any Man hath by our Law any Eſtate, Right, or Priviledge, by any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular means, he is bound to take notice of all the Conditions and Qualifications annexed thereto: And the Reaſon is juſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the ſame means, by which he had notice of the Benefit, gives him notice of the reſtrictive Limitation and Penalty, and ſo was it held in the Caſe of <hi>Fry</hi> and <hi>Porter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By our Law no Benefit can accrue to a Man by a Judgment gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:50172:32"/>on a Thing ariſing <hi>extra poteſtatem Curiae,</hi> in caſe of a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar and limited Juriſdiction; as in the Caſe of <hi>Kingſton upon Hull, March</hi> 8. which held Plea of Debt upon a Bond made <hi>extra Jur', &amp;c.</hi> and a <hi>Jud',</hi> and <hi>Capias</hi> executed, and an Eſcape; and no Action lay for the Eſcape, becauſe all was void, and <hi>coram non Judice:</hi> In the ſame Book, <hi>March.</hi> 117, 118. <hi>Dye</hi> and <hi>Olive</hi>'s Caſe, in Falſe Impriſonment, Plea that he was Serjeant at Mace belonging to a Court of Record, and that a Warrant was directed to him to Arreſt the Plaintiff <hi>pro quodam Contemptu,</hi> and held not good, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe not ſhewn, in what Action, and how within the Juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and if not within it, 'twas <hi>coram non judice,</hi> and void, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued by <hi>Rolls</hi> and <hi>Maynard.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then 'twas argued, That this was a limited qualified Power; that the Viſitor was a Creature of the Founders; and if it had been the Heir of the Founder, he had been as much bound and reſtrained by the Statutes, as a Stranger: and tho' the Law ſhould be agreed to be, as is pretended, that it appoints a Viſitor, yet ſtill (whether he be the Heir or Nominee of the Founder) he is an Officer only within the Limits and Rules of the Foundation, and the Statutes made thereupon: As he hath a Viſitatorial Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er only over this Colledge, ſo he hath it only after the manner in which 'tis given to him.</p>
            <p>If the Founder had made no particular Viſitor, but yet had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed that the ſame ſhould be viſitable at ſuch a time, and in ſuch a form, he himſelf had been bound by theſe Rules; and if he would have been ſo confined, with much more, or at leaſt with the ſame Reaſon, ought his Nominee; for <hi>cujus est dare, ejus est diſponere;</hi> and every Argument which hath been urged for the Rector's being ſubject to the Rules of the Foundation, may likewiſe be applied to that of the Viſitor: He that made the Viſitor, may reſtrain, ſhape, and modifie the Power which he gives him: He might have made him Viſitor only once in his Life, or only upon Requeſt, and have left all other Juriſdiction to the Rector and Fellows.</p>
            <p>But further, here he is found to be Viſitor only <hi>ſecundum for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mam ſtatut' &amp; vigore ſtatut',</hi> and to execute thoſe Statutes; and that which makes him a Viſitor, makes him ſuch thus and thus qualified, and no otherwiſe: whatſoever Power or Authority the Name or Office of a Viſitor may import <hi>ex vi termini,</hi> no Man can ſay but this Viſitor is controuled by the Statutes, which make him ſo; now had there been no Statutes, he had never been Viſitor; then theſe Statutes making him a Viſitor, upon particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Terms and Conditions, Times and Occaſions; <hi>extra</hi> theſe Terms and Conditions he is no Viſitor at all; this ſeems plain and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral: So that if he exceeds the Bounds preſcribed to him as Viſitor, he doth not act as Viſitor; for all Powers, Authorities, and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdictions, eſpecially ſuch as are created by private Perſons, muſt be executed according to the expreſs Inſtitution, or plain mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Party that created them, and according to the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, with which he hath circumſcrib'd them: So is the Rule
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:50172:33"/>in <hi>Berwick</hi>'s Caſe, 5 <hi>Rep.</hi> 94. and 1 <hi>Inſt.</hi> 113. and 258. An Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutor is an Officer or Perſon inſtruſted, which is taken notice of by the Law, yet in his Creation he may be limited <hi>quoad</hi> the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate in one Country, or <hi>quoad</hi> one Particular, and he can't in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termeddle any further; but Adminiſtration ſhall be granted as to the reſt.</p>
            <p>Then 'tis obſervable, That this Statute Viſitor is not a Court of Record, nor any Court at all, but rather like an Arbitrator under certain Directions, he can neither meddle at another Time, or with other Matters, or in other Manner, then what is preſcribed. But admitting it a ſort of Judicature, here's no Appeal or Writ of Error, or Prohibition or <hi>Mandamus</hi> lies; nay, the Viſitor himſelf cannot relieve againſt his own Sentence, or reſtore the Party deprived the next day; but the Place being vacant, a right of Election accrues to the Fellows; 'tis therefore unreaſonable to ſuppoſe him not reſtrained, or that his Acts, if exceeding the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits and Rules ſet him, ſhall be concluſive and binding.</p>
            <p>This is like a Lay-Hoſpital, 'tis not a Religious Body, tho' ſome call it mixt; and in caſe of Temporal Lay-Offices, there muſt be ſome Remedy at Law, as is 13 <hi>Rep.</hi> 70. ſo is <hi>Dyer</hi> 209. and 3 <hi>Inſt.</hi> 340. Where no Appeal is allowed, another Examination muſt be admitted; and thus ſeems the 8 <hi>Aſſiſ. pl.</hi> 29. tho' it hath been quoted on the other ſide; If the Warden of an Hoſpital be irregularly deprived, he ſhall have his Remedy at Law; and 13 <hi>Aſſiſ.</hi> 2. to the ſame effect: <hi>Bagges</hi>'s Caſe, 11 <hi>Rep.</hi> repeats the ſame Caſe, which ſhews <hi>Coke</hi>'s Opinion to concur with it; and tho' an Aſſize doth not properly lye, yet the meaning is, he ſhall have Relief, <hi>i. e.</hi> ſuch Suit at Law as is proper to his Caſe: The ſame Diſtinction is allowed in Dr. <hi>Sutton</hi>'s Caſe, <hi>Latch.</hi> 229. And that a Remedy is given by the Law in this Caſe of a Temporal Property, ſeems to be plainly affirmed in the Statute of 24 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 12. And further, Tho' ſtrictly and properly it were not of Common Law connuſance, yet it falling incidently to be a Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion upon trial of a Title, the Court before whom that Suit de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends, muſt examine that incident; as in caſe of an Iſſue, law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully joyned in Marriage or not, the Trial ſhall be by Certificate of the Ordinary; but if it be a Queſtion upon the Trial of a Title to Land, the Matter ſhall be tried and judged without Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificate.</p>
            <p>The wiſdom of our Law hath been ſuch, as very rarely to truſt any of the Courts of Juſtice with the final determination of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Law in the firſt Inſtance; and 'twould be ſtrange that this Caſe of a Viſitor ſhould ſtand ſingle by it ſelf. Beſides to prevent a failure of Juſtice, the Law doth of neceſſity admit of ſeveral other proviſions and methods of Examination or Tryal, than what the ſubject matter or perſon would properly in their own nature require, eſpecially in point of remedy and relief, as appears in <hi>Dormer</hi>'s Caſe, 5 <hi>Rep.</hi> 40. and 1 <hi>Inſt.</hi> 54. 2 <hi>Roll</hi>'s <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridg.</hi> 587. now here is no other remedy, nor other way of trial,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:50172:33"/>for Deprivation is not triable by Certificate, but only in caſe of an Eccleſiaſtical perſon.</p>
            <p>As to the Objection from <hi>Appleford</hi>'s Caſe, <hi>Sid.</hi> 71. there that Writ was fully anſwered, and they could not Examine into the truth and falſity of that Anſwer, but muſt leave the party to his Action; and it doth not thence follow, That in an Action, there's no remedy: But the ſtrongeſt Objection is, that in pleading a Deprivation, you need not ſhew the Cauſe, and it muſt be taken ſor juſt and good, as <hi>Moore</hi> 781. <hi>Jones</hi> 393. <hi>Moore</hi> 228. 2 <hi>Roll</hi>'s <hi>Abridg.</hi> 219. 9 <hi>Edw.</hi> 4.25. that need only ſhew by whom: All theſe ſtand upon the ſame foundation, they were by Authority Eccleſiaſtical, and muſt ſtand till Repealed; and even thoſe Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the High Commiſſion Court, they were by the courſe of the Eccleſiaſtical Law, which was ſaved to them by the Proviſo, in 1 <hi>Eliz.</hi> and therefore ſhall be intended ſo, till the contrary ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear: and even there 'twas, <hi>debito modo privatus,</hi> which implies, all due requiſites; but here the whole is diſcloſed, upon a ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Verdict; 'tis not found here, that he was duly deprived; but that he was deprived after ſuch a manner, which if it appears to have been without Authority, muſt be null: As to <hi>Ley</hi>'s Opinion in <hi>Davis</hi> 47. that a Sentence of Deprivation in caſe of a Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive by an Ordinary, was effectual in Law, till Reverſed; that's not Law, for 'twas all <hi>coram non judice, Bro. Praemunire</hi> 21. <hi>Nat. Br.</hi> 42. the Ordinary cannot viſit a Benefice Donative.</p>
            <p>Then they Object, That this is an Elemoſinary intereſt, and the Rector took it under thoſe terms of ſubjection to ſuch a Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitor, but that is the Queſtion, what thoſe terms are, and the conſequences of ſuch an Opinion may be dangerous to the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities, thoſe Nurſeries of Learning and good Manners, 'tis to make them too precarious and dependent upon will.</p>
            <p>And as to the pretence that the Land was the Founders, and he might diſpoſe of it at pleaſure, it was anſwered, that before the Gift, the Lands and the Profits and the Ownerſhip were all ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the Common-Law, and the Owner could not give ſuch a Power as is pretended, no more than he could oblige all differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces about his Eſtate to be finally determined by a particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and his Heirs or Succeſſors: no Abſolute Power can be fixed in this Nation by Cuſtom, but rather then the ſame ſhall be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, the Cuſtom ſhall be void; 1 <hi>Inſt.</hi> 14. <hi>Davis</hi> 32. 2 <hi>Roll</hi>'s <hi>Abridg.</hi> 265. Copyholds were Anciently at mere will and pleaſure, but the Lord is now obliged to, and by certain Rules: by our Law the Power of Parents over Children is qualified and reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; 'tis no Argument, to ſay that the Viſitor comes in <hi>loco</hi> or <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce fundatoris,</hi> for the Alienation and the Statutes did oblige even himſelf: and though perhaps if no Statutes had been made, his Viſitatorial Power had been much larger, yet ſince 'tis limitted to once in five Years, and his Acts to be with others conſent, 'tis as much as if he had given the Colledge a priviledge of exemption by Words Expreſs, from any Viſitation, at all other times, and in all other manners, than thoſe which are mentioned: then was
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:50172:34"/>Cited the Caſe of <hi>Terry</hi> and <hi>Huntington,</hi> in <hi>Scaccar' Trin.</hi> 20 <hi>Car. II.</hi> in <hi>Hardres</hi>'s <hi>Rep.</hi> 480. before Sir <hi>Matthew Hale,</hi> Trover for Goods, ſeized by Warrant of the Commiſſioners of Exciſe, the Query was, when they adjudged low Wines to be ſtrong Wines perfectly made, upon 12 <hi>Car. II. cap.</hi> 23. whether it might be drawn in Queſtion again by an Action in <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall,</hi> and held it might, though they were Judges, and though the Statute gave an Appeal; and the reaſons given there ſeem to reach this Caſe, becauſe they had a ſtinted limitted Juriſdiction, and that implies a Negative, <hi>viz.</hi> that they ſhall not proceed at all in any other Caſes; and that ſpecial Juriſdictions might be and frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly were circumſcribed, 1. with reſpect to place, as a Leet or a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration Court; 2. with reſpect to perſons, as in the Caſe of the <hi>Marſhalſea;</hi> 3. with reſpect to the ſubject matter of their Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction: And if Judgment be given in another place, or upon other perſons, or about other matters, that all was void and <hi>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram non judice;</hi> and though 'twas objected, that ſtrong Wines were within their Juriſdiction, and that 'twas only a miſtake in their Judgment; yet it appearing upon the ſpecial Verdict, that they were low Wines, the Action was held maintainable; this is ſo plain, it needs no Application.</p>
            <p>Then it was argued, that this Sentence was void, 1. becauſe there was no Authority to viſit at this time, there having been a Viſitation by the Commiſſary within five Years before; that no words in the Statute make him a Viſitor generally, but only <hi>ſecund' ſtat'</hi> i.e. upon requeſt, or without requeſt, <hi>a quinquennio in quinquenium, Semel.</hi> now here's no requeſt found; then the Act of Dr. <hi>Maſters</hi> as Commiſſary is an exerciſe of the Viſitor's Office; <hi>Colmer</hi>'s Appeal was to the Biſhop as Viſitor; <hi>Semel.</hi> implies a negation of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it more frequent: according to Grammar, it ſignifies once and not often er or, once for all: If <hi>Semel</hi> comes alone, without any other Particle, then 'tis but once, and if with another, as <hi>ne Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel,</hi> 'tis not once, or never: and the <hi>liceat Semel</hi> can have no other Conſtruction; it can't mean once at the leaſt, as was argued below, eſpecially as oppoſed to requeſt: and no Argument can be drawn from the neceſſity of frequent Viſitations, for that Evils are not to be preſumed; and over inferior Members, there's a Power in the Rector and four Seniors: now Dr. <hi>Maſters</hi> was not requeſted by the Colledge, nay, they proteſt againſt it in ſome Degree, <hi>i. e.</hi> ſo far as relates to <hi>Colmer</hi>'s reſtitution; the Oath of a Scholar being againſt Appeals: and the Oaths and the Contents of them are to be deemed part of their Conſtitution; But ſuppoſing that Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs might be examined as a thing proper for Conſideration, when an inquiry is made into the State of the College; and the admiſſion, continuance, and removal of the Members is certainly one Article of ſuch inquiry, yet that muſt be done in Viſitation, and as Viſitor, for there's no other Power found in the ſerdict but that.</p>
            <pb n="55" facs="tcp:50172:34"/>
            <p n="2">2. Admitting that no Action of Dr. <hi>Maſters</hi> to be Viſitation, yet this Sentence is void, becauſe it held above three days, and the Statutes ſay, after three days it ſhall be taken <hi>pro terminat' &amp; diſſolut'.</hi> On the 16. of <hi>June</hi> he comes with intention to viſit, doth an Act proper to his Office and Buſineſs, examines the Summoner about the Citati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; if he had come and only examined and made no Decree, it had been a Viſitation; and either 'tis a <hi>quinquennial</hi> one of it ſelf, or it is a Commencement of one, and either one way or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it makes the Deprivation void: 'tis afterwards entred as a Viſitatorial Act; <hi>Eundem actum pro parte hujuſmodi negotii Viſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionis haberi decrevit,</hi> and then he adjourns; 'tis no Argument to ſay that he was hindred, for he might have proceeded <hi>in abſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia;</hi> and if the 16th of <hi>June</hi> be tacked to it, 'tis longer than the time: There needed no formal adjournment, for that he is Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized to proceed in a Summary way; 'tis no ſuch abſurdity to call that a Viſitation which was in ſome ſort hindred, ſince notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the obſtruction ſome Acts were done, and more might have been by adjourning to another place.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Here was no ſuch cauſe as could warrant a Deprivation, it was not one of the cauſes mentioned in the Statutes, which are not dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions merely, but they are the conſtituent Qualifications of the Power; and Contumacy is none of the cauſes, nay, here is no Contumacy at all: The Offence of the Suſpended Fellows, was only a miſtake in their Opinions, and the Doctors was no more; and 'tis not a Contumacy for refuſing to anſwer to, or for any Crime within the Statutes, for there was none of the Crimes men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the Statutes laid to the charge of the Rector; if the Crime charged had incurred Deprivation, perhaps a Contumacy might be Evidence of a Guilt of that Crime, and ſo deſerve the ſame Cenſure; but Contumacy in not conſenting to a Viſitation can never be ſuch, eſpecially when the conſenting to a Viſitation is not required under pain of Deprivation.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Admitting the Viſitor legally in the Exerciſe of his Office, that here was cauſe of Cenſure; that the Cauſe or Crime was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving of that Puniſhment which was inflicted; that Deprivati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was a congruous Penalty for ſuch an Offence: yet twas argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, That this Sentence was void; for that the Viſitor alone was in this Caſe <hi>minus competens judex,</hi> becauſe his Authority was par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly deſigned to be exerciſed with the conſent of others, which was wanting in this Caſe: This was the ſame as if it had required the concurrence of ſome other Perſons <hi>Extra Colleg'</hi> then that ſuch a concurrence was neceſſary, appears from the words of the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, his meaning ſeems plain upon the whole, to require it. A greater tenderneſs is all along ſhewn to the Rector, then to the Scholars, 'tis <hi>ſine quorum conſenſu irrita erit hujuſmodi Expulſio &amp; vacua ipſo facto:</hi> and the Sentence it ſelf ſhews it neceſſary, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it affirms it ſelf to be made with ſuch conſent; and it cannot be thought that the Rector ſhould be deprivable without their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, when the meaneſt Scholar could not.</p>
            <pb n="56" facs="tcp:50172:35"/>
            <p>Then here's no ſuch conſent, for 'tis not of the four Seniors, but of the four Seniors not Suſpended; now this doth not fulfil the Command of the Statute, for the Suſpenſion doth not make them to be no Fellows, a Suſpended Fellow is a Fellow though Suſpended; a Suſpenſion makes no vacancy; the taking off of the Suſpenſion by Sentence or by Effluxion of time, doth make them capable of acting ſtill, without the aid of any new Election, and they are in upon their old choice, and have all the priviledges of Seniority and Precedency as before.</p>
            <p>If they ceaſed to be Fellows by the Suſpenſion, then they ought to undergo the <hi>Annum probationis</hi> again, and to take the Oaths again: In caſe of Benefices or Offices, Religious or Civil, Eccleſiaſtical or Temporal, 'tis ſo; a Suſpenſion in this Caſe is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a diſabling them from taking the Profits during the time it continues: And 'tis no Argument to ſay, That their Concurrence was not neceſſary, for that they had withdrawn themſelves, and were guilty of Contumacy; for that a Man guilty of Contuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy might be preſent, if withdrawn from the Chapel, he might be in the Colledge, or in the Univerſity, and 'tis not found that they were abſent: and then their Conſent not being had, the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence was void and null, and conſequently no Title found for the Leſſor of the Plaintiff in the Action below.</p>
            <p>It was replied in behalf of the Plaintiff, much to the ſame effect as 'twas argued before, and great weight laid upon the Contuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, which hindred the obſervance of the Statutes; that by allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch a Behaviour in a Colledge, no Will of the Founder could be fulfilled, no Viſitation could ever be had; and all the Statutes would be repealed or made void at once; that tho' this Crime was not mentioned, 'twas as great, or greater than any of the reſt; that here was an Authority, and well executed, and upon a juſt Cauſe, and in a regular manner, as far as the Rector's own Misbehaviour did not prevent it; and therefore they prayed that the Judgment might be reverſed? And upon Debate the ſame was reverſed accordingly.</p>
            <p>Note, That in this Caſe there was one Doubt conceived before, and another after this hearing: The firſt was, If a Writ of Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror lay in Parliament immediately upon a Judgment in the <hi>King's Bench,</hi> without firſt reſorting to the <hi>Exchequer Chamber;</hi> but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on peruſing the Statute which erects that Court for Examination of Errors, it appeared plainly that that Act only gives the Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Party aggrieved to go thither; that it did not take away the old Common Law method of Relief in Parliament, and ſo hath the Practiſe been; but upon Judgments in the <hi>Exchequer Court,</hi> the Writ of Error muſt firſt be brought before the Lord Chancellor, and cannot come <hi>per ſaltum</hi> into Parliament, becauſe the Statute in that caſe expreſly ordains, That Errors in the Court of <hi>Exchequer</hi> ſhall be examined there; and ſo held in the Caſe of
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:50172:35"/>the Earl of <hi>Macclesfield</hi> and <hi>Groſvenor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The other Doubt was raiſed by a Motion in <hi>B. R.</hi> for the Court to give a new Judgment upon the Reverſal above; and inſiſted on, that it ought ſo to be, as was done in the Caſe of <hi>Faldo</hi> and <hi>Ridge, Yelv.</hi> 74. entred <hi>Trin.</hi> 2 <hi>Jac.</hi> 1. <hi>Rot.</hi> 267. Treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs and Special Plea, and Judgment in <hi>B. R.</hi> for the Defendant; and upon Writ of Error in the <hi>Exchequer Chamber,</hi> the Judgment was Reverſed; and upon the Record returned into the <hi>King</hi>'s <hi>Bench,</hi> they gave Judgment that the Plaintiff ſhould recover con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the firſt Judgment: for otherwiſe they ſaid, the Law would prove defective; and a Precedent was ſhewn in <hi>Winch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comb</hi>'s Caſe, 38 <hi>Eliz.</hi> where the ſame Courſe was taken; and the like Rule was made <hi>Mich.</hi> 1 <hi>W. &amp; Mar.</hi> upon the Reverſal of the Judgment <hi>inter Claxton verſ.

            <p>WRit of Error to Reverſe a Judgment in the Court of <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer,</hi> affirmed upon a Writ of Error before the Lord Chancellor, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Caſe upon the Record was thus; <hi>Donmille</hi> declares in the <hi>Exchequer in placito tranſgr' &amp; contempt',</hi> &amp;c. for a Proſecution <hi>contra regiam prohibit',</hi> and ſets forth <hi>Magna Charta</hi> that <hi>nullus liber homo,</hi> &amp;c. that the Plaintiff is a Freeman of this Kingdom, and ought to enjoy the free Cuſtoms thereof, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that the Defendant not being ignorant of the Premiſſes, but deſigning to vex and aggrieve the Plaintiff, did <hi>in Curia militari Henrici Ducis</hi> Norfolk' <hi>coram ipſo Henrico Com' Mareſchal'</hi> Exhibit certain Articles againſt the Plaintiff, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that Sir <hi>Henry St. George Claren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieux</hi> King at Arms, was, and is King at Arms for the <hi>Southern, Eaſtern,</hi> and <hi>Weſtern</hi> Parts of the Kingdom, <hi>viz.</hi> from the River of <hi>Trent verſus Auſtrum,</hi> and that the Conuſance, Correction, and Diſpoſition of Arms, and Coats of Arms, and ordering of Fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Pomps time out of mind, did belong to him within that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince; and that the Plaintiff having notice thereof, did, without any Licence in that behalf had and obtained, paint, and cauſe to be painted, Arms and Eſcutcheons, and cauſed them to be fixed to Herſes, that he provided and lent Velvet Palls for Funerals; that he painted divers Arms for one <hi>Berkstead,</hi> who had no right to their uſe at the Funeral, and did lend a Pall for that Funeral, and paint Arms for <hi>Elizabeth Godfrey,</hi> and marſhalled the Funeral, and the like for <hi>Sprignall:</hi> and that he had publickly hanging out at his Balcony Eſcutcheons painted, and Coaches and Herſes, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Publick Proceſſions of Funerals, to entice People to come to his Houſe and Shop for Arms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That the Defendant compelled the Plaintiff to appear and anſwer the Premiſſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Defendant <hi>in propria perſona ſua venit &amp; dicit,</hi> That the Court of the Conſtable and Marſhal of <hi>England</hi> is an ancient Court, time out of mind, and accuſtomed to be held before the Conſtable of <hi>England,</hi> and the Earl Marſhal of <hi>England</hi> for the time being, or before the Conſtable only when the Office of Earl Marſhal is vacant; or before the Earl Marſhal only when the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Conſtable is vacant; which Court hath, time out of mind, had Conuſance of all Pleas and Cauſes concerning Arms, Eſcut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheons, Genealogies, and Funerals within this Realm, and that no other Perſon hath ever intermeddled in thoſe Pleas or Affairs, nor had or claimed Juriſdiction thereof; and that the Suit complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of by the Plaintiff was proſecuted in the ſaid ancient Court of and for Cauſes concerning Arms, Eſcutcheons, and Funerals: That by the 13 <hi>Rich.</hi> 2. 'twas enacted, that if any Perſon ſhould com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of any Plea begun before the Conſtable and Marſhal, which might be tried by the Common Law, he ſhould have a Privy
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:50172:36"/>Seal without difficulty to be directed to the Conſtable and Marſhal to Superſede that Plea, till diſcuſſed by the King's Counſel, if it belongs to that Court or to the Common Law, <hi>prout per Statut' ill' apparet,</hi> and that the ſaid Court, time out of mind, hath been <hi>tant' honoris &amp; celſitudinis,</hi> that it was never prohibited from hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any Pleas in the ſame Court <hi>aliter vel alio modo quam juxta for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mam Statut' praed' Et hoc parat' est verificare unde non intendit quod Curia hic placitum praed' ulterius cognoſcere velit aut debeat,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The Plaintiff demurs, and the Defendant joyns.</p>
            <p>From the <hi>Exchequer Court</hi> this was adjourned <hi>propter difficulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem</hi> into the <hi>Exchequer Chamber,</hi> and afterwards by advice of the Judges there, the Court gave Judgment for the Plaintiff, which was affirmed by the Chancellor and Treaſurer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now it was argued on the behalf of the Plaintiff in the Writ of Error, that this Judgment was erroneous, and fit to be reverſed.</p>
            <p>And firſt to maintain the Court as ſet forth, 'twas inſiſted on 1. That when there was a Conſtable and Marſhal, the Marſhal had equal Power of Judicature with the Conſtable, as each Judge hath in other Courts. 2. That the Conſtable had in that Court power of Judicature alone, when there was no Marſhal. And 3. That the Marſhal had the like, when there was no Conſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
            <p>That they had both equal power of Judicature, appeared by all their Proceedings; by their Libels or Bills, in the Caſe of <hi>John Keightley</hi> Eſq; againſt <hi>Stephen Scroop:</hi> The Libel is, <hi>In the Name of God, Amen. Before you my Lords the Conſtable and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal of</hi> England <hi>in your Court of Chivalry, and prays that the ſaid</hi> Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen, <hi>by their Sentence definitive, may be puniſht,</hi> 1 <hi>pars Pat. 2 Hen.</hi> 4. <hi>m.</hi> 7. And the ſame <hi>Stephen</hi> libelled againſt <hi>Keightley</hi> to the thrice Honourable Lords the Conſtable and Marſhal of <hi>England.</hi> So the Libels were directed to both, and both ſate judicially.</p>
            <p>The ſame appears by the Sentence or Judgment given in that Court: <hi>Bulmer</hi> libelled againſt <hi>Bertram <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſau coram Conſtabulario &amp; Mareſchallo, qui duellum inter partes allocaverunt &amp; aſſignaverunt locum &amp; tempus, Rot.

Thus it appears by a Commiſſion for the Execution of the Office of Conſtable of <hi>England, Committimus vobis officium hujuſmodi Conſtabularii ad querelam</hi> Thome Moor <hi>in hac parte una cum</hi> Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mundo de Mortimore <hi>Mareſchallo</hi> Anglie <hi>audiendum; ſecunda pars Patent'</hi> 48 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. <hi>m.</hi> 20. <hi>in dorſo.</hi> As alſo by a Claim at
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:50172:37"/>the Coronation of <hi>H.</hi> 5. before <hi>Beauchamp</hi> Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi> then Lord Steward. <hi>John Mowbray</hi> Earl Marſhal, Son to the then Duke of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> claimed under a Grant in 20th of <hi>Rich.</hi> 2. of the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Earl Marſhal of <hi>England,</hi> to hold Court with the Conſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and to hold Pleas before them: and Copies of theſe Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedents were ſaid to have been ready in Court.</p>
            <p>Further, to prove the joynt Authority, were cited ſeveral of our Old Books, 48 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. <hi>fol.</hi> 3. in a Caſe of Debt upon an Indenture by which <hi>P.</hi> was retained by the Defendant, with two Squires of Arms for the War in <hi>France: Belknapp</hi> ſaid, of ſuch Matter this Court cannot have conuſance, but 'tis triable before the Conſtable and Marſhal. In the Caſe of <hi>Pountney</hi> and <hi>Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney</hi> 13 <hi>Hen.</hi> 4.4. the Court of <hi>King's Bench</hi> call it the Court of the Conſtable and Marſhal: And in 37 <hi>Hen.</hi> 6.3. upon another occaſion, <hi>Priſot</hi> ſaid, this Matter belongs to the Conſtable and Marſhal: And <hi>Coke</hi> 4 <hi>Inſt.</hi> 123. ſays that they are both Judges of the Court: and that the Conſtable ſometimes gave Sentence, is no Argument that the Marſhal was no Judge with him; it only proves him the Chief, who in moſt Courts doth uſually give the Rule: Nor is the Earl Marſhal's receiving Writs from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable to execute his Commands, any Argument that he ſits there only as a Miniſterial Officer, and not as a Judge; for he may be both; as in many Corporations, Mayors are Judges of the Court, and yet have the Cuſtody of their Goals too, and ſo have the Sheriffs of <hi>London</hi> their Compters, tho' they ſtrictly are Judges of their ſeveral Courts.</p>
            <p n="2">2. During the Vacancy of the Earl Marſhal's Office, the Conſtable alone had the Judicature; as in 11 <hi>Hen.</hi> 7. on <hi>Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rood-day,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Darby</hi> being then Conſtable of <hi>England,</hi> ſate and gave Judgment alone in a Cauſe between Sir <hi>Thomas Aſhton</hi> and Sir <hi>Piers Leigh</hi> upon a Coat of Arms: but this needs no Proof, ſince 'tis contended on the other ſide, that the Court doth belong only to the Conſtable.</p>
            <p n="3">3. 'Twas argued, that the Earl Marſhal hath ſet alone and given Judgment, and to prove that, it was ſaid, this Court was held when there was no Conſtable, before <hi>Thomas Howard,</hi> Duke of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> Lord High Treaſurer and Earl Marſhal of <hi>England,</hi> who Died 16 <hi>Hen.</hi> VIII. and next after him, before <hi>Charles Brandon,</hi> Duke of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> then Earl Marſhal, who Died 37 <hi>Hen.</hi> VIII. af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him, the Court was held and Sentences given by <hi>Thomas Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi> Duke of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> who Died in 1512. and after him, in the 30 <hi>Eliz.</hi> the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> ſat as Earl Marſhal, and heard and determined Cauſes judicially, and the chief Judge ſat then as Aſſiſtant with him in Court, and then after the Death of the Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> it was in Commiſſion to my Lord Treaſurer <hi>Burleigh,</hi> and others, and then the great Oaſe of Sir <hi>F. Mitchell,</hi> was heard and determined, at which, ſeveral Judges aſſiſted, and the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of degradation was executed upon him, 26. <hi>April,</hi> 1621.
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:50172:37"/>and then was Cited the Caſe of <hi>Pool</hi> and <hi>Redhead</hi> 12 <hi>Jac.</hi> 1.1 <hi>Roll</hi>'s <hi>Rep.</hi> 87. where 'twas held, that the proper remedy for Fees of Knighthood was to ſue to the Earl Marſhal; and <hi>Coke</hi> ſays in the ſame Caſe, the Common-Law does not give remedy for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedency, but it belongs to the Earl Marſhal: And ſince that in <hi>Parker</hi>'s Caſe, which was 20 <hi>Car.</hi> II. <hi>Syd.</hi> 353. the Earl Marſhal was agreed to have the abſolute determination of matters of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour in the Court of <hi>Chivalry,</hi> as much as the Chancellor hath in matters of Equity: And the Error on the other ſide, was occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned by not diſtinguiſhing between the Ancient Juriſdiction of this great Court at the Common-Law, and the Juriſdiction given to the Conſtable and Marſhal under thoſe names by Statute: for the latter cannot be executed by one alone; and that diſtinction anſwers the Authority in 1 <hi>Inſt.</hi> 74. which grounded the miſtake, that there is no Court of <hi>Chivalry,</hi> becauſe there's no Conſtable, whereas, the reaſon why in Sir <hi>Francis Drake</hi>'s Caſe, the not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituting of a Conſtable ſilenced the Appeal, was from the 1 <hi>Hen.</hi> IV. <hi>Cap.</hi> 14. which orders all Appeals of Murder committed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond Sea to be before the Conſtable and Marſhal by name: But the Ancient Juriſdiction of this Court by preſcription, wherein both the Conſtable and Marſhal were Judges ſeverally or together, and which each of them did and could hold alone, remains ſtill as much in the Earl Marſhal alone, as it ever was in him and the Conſtable.</p>
            <p>Then it was argued that no Prohibition lay to this Court, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe none had ever been granted, and yet greater occaſions then now can be pretended, by reaſon of the large Juriſdiction, which this Court did in Ancient time exerciſe: many Petitions were frequently preferred in Parliament, Complaining of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachments of this Court in <hi>Edw.</hi> I. <hi>Edw.</hi> III. <hi>Rich.</hi> II. <hi>Hen.</hi> IV. and <hi>Hen.</hi> VIth's time, as appears in 4 <hi>Inst.</hi> 125. 2 <hi>Hen.</hi> IV. num. 79. and 99. 1 <hi>Roll</hi>'s <hi>Abridg.</hi> 527. and yet no Prohibition gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted or moved for; which, according to <hi>Littleton</hi>'s Text is a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſtrong Argument, that it doth not lie.</p>
            <p>The Statute of 13 <hi>Rich.</hi> II. 2. is an Argument againſt it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe after ſeveral Complaints of the Incroachments of this Court, another remedy is given, which had been needleſs, if this had been legal: nay, it ſhews the Opinion of the Parliament, that there was no other way of relief: and ſoon after the making of this Statute, in the ſame Reign two Privy Seals were ſued upon it: in the Caſe of <hi>Poultney</hi> and <hi>Bourney,</hi> 13 <hi>Hen.</hi> IV. 4. 5.</p>
            <p>Beſides, this might be grounded on the Antiquity and greatneſs of this Court: for as to the ſubject matter of it, 'tis by Preſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion a Court for determining matters of Honour, to preſerve the diſtinction of degrees and quality, of which no other Courts have Juriſdiction; and the right and property in Honours and Arms is as neceſſary to be preſerved in a Civil Government, as that in Lands or Goods. Then 'twas urged that this Court hath Juriſdiction even of Capital Offences, its extent is large, 'tis throughout the Realm, even in Counties Palatine, even beyond
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:50172:38"/>the Seas; its manner of proceeding is different, in a Summary way by Petition, its trial of Fact may be by Duel as is 4 <hi>Inſt.</hi> 125. though the Statutes of <hi>Hen.</hi> VIII. impower Commiſſions for trial of Treaſons Committed beyond the Seas, yet this Court doth and may ſtill take Conuſance of ſuch Cauſes, 4 <hi>Inſt.</hi> 124. Its Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences are only reverſable by and upon Appeal to the King, no Writ of Error or falſe Judgment lies upon any of them, which ſhews the greatneſs of the Court, and the difference of its Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction from other Courts; which may be ſome of thereaſons, why no Prohibition was ever granted to it, and why the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Rich.</hi> II. gave the Remedy of a Privy Seal: wherefore it was prayed that the Judgment ſhould be Reverſed.</p>
            <p>On the other ſide, it was argued by the Council, in behalf of the Plaintiff in the Original Action, that this Judgment ought to be affirmed, and it was after this manner, there ſeem three Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in the Caſe; 1. If any Prohibition lies to that Court; 2. If any Cauſe here for a Prohibition; and, 3. If there be any ſuch Court as that before the Earl Marſhal; but another doubt was raiſed, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any of theſe Queſtions could be ſuch upon this plea, which is concluded to the Juriſdiction; for that ſeems to make only one doubt; whether the Court of Exchequer could hold Plea of an Action for proceeding contrary to a Prohibition already gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; but this was waved, and then it was argued,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That a Prohibition doth lie to this Court of Chivalry, in caſe it exceeds the Juriſdiction proper to it; and it was agreed, that the Office of Conſtable is Ancient, and by <hi>Cambden</hi> is held to have been in Ure in this Kingdom, in the <hi>Saxon</hi>'s time, though the Office of Marſhal is but of a <hi>puiſne date:</hi> but however Great and Noble the Office is, however large and Extenſive the Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction is, yet 'tis but limitted, and <hi>Coke</hi> in 4 <hi>Inſt.</hi> 123. ſays that 'tis declared ſo, by the Statute of <hi>Rich.</hi> II. where 'tis ſaid, that they incroached in great prejudice of the King's Courts, and to the great grievance and oppreſſion of his people, and that their proper Buſineſs is to have conuſance of Contracts and Deeds of Arms, and of War out of the Realm, which cannot be determined or diſcuſſed by the Common-Law, which other Conſtables have heretofore duly and reaſonably uſed in their time; now by this Act 'tis plain, what the Juriſdiction is: Contracts and Deeds of Arms, and War out of the Realm, are the ſubject matter of it; and by <hi>Coke</hi> 'tis called, <hi>curia militaris,</hi> or the Fountain of Marſhal Law: which ſhews it a Court, that hath its boundaries, a Court that may incroach, nay, which hath incroach'd in diverſe inſtances belonging to the Common-Law: And that 'tis a Court that ought to meddle with nothing that may be Determined in <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall:</hi> then there muſt be ſome way of reſtraining this exceſs and theſe incroachments, and if the Statute of <hi>Rich.</hi> II. had not been made, it muſt be agreed that a Prohibition would have lain, for elſe there had been no remedy, which is abſurd to affirm.</p>
            <pb n="63" facs="tcp:50172:38"/>
            <p>'Tis no Objection that Prohibitions are only grantable to Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Courts, and that this is one of the greateſt Courts in the Realm, for if a Court Marſhal intermeddle with a Common-Law matter, <hi>ea ratione,</hi> it becomes inferior and may be controwled: There needs no conteſt about the Superiority of Courts in this matter, 'tis the ſame here, as among private Perſons, he that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends becomes inferior, and ſubject to the Cenſure of his equal by offending; though that Court ſhould be reckoned ſo noble and great as hath been repreſented, yet 'tis only ſo, while it keeps within its Juriſdiction; Prohibitions are grantable to almoſt all ſort of Courts, which differ from the Common-Law in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding, to Courts Chriſtian, to the Admiralty, nay, to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legates, and even to the Steward and Marſhal, upon the Statute of <hi>Articuli ſuper Chartas,</hi> Cap. 3. That they ſhall not hold Plea of Freehold or of Treſpaſs, <hi>Fits' N.B.</hi> 241, 242. is an expreſs Writ of Prohibition, though the Statute gave no ſuch Writ, but only did reſtrain the Juriſdiction of the Court; which in truth, is the Caſe in Queſtion, antecedent to the Statute pleaded.</p>
            <p>No Argument can be raiſed from the ſubject matter of the Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of this Court, that 'tis different from the Common-Law, for ſo is the Admiralty and the Prerogative Courts, nor is it any Objection that upon any Grievance in this Court, the Appeal muſt be to the King, for that holds in the other Courts with equal reaſon: Nay, Prohibitions lie from <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall,</hi> to hinder proceeding in Cauſes, which the Courts that grant ſuch Prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, cannot hold Plea of; as to the Eccleſiaſtical Court which grants probate of a Will made within a Mannor, to the Lord whereof ſuch probate belongs, 5 <hi>Rep.</hi> 73. to the Marches of <hi>Wales,</hi> if hold Plea of what belongs to Court Chriſtian, 2 <hi>Roll</hi>'s <hi>Abridg.</hi> 313. are ſeveral Caſes to this purpoſe: there were alſo Cited, 1 <hi>Roll</hi>'s <hi>Rep.</hi> 42. 2 <hi>Roll</hi>'s <hi>Abridg.</hi> 317. <hi>Sid.</hi> 189. 1 <hi>Brownl.</hi> 143, 144. and <hi>Herne</hi> 543. 'twas further urged, that there neither was nor could be any reaſon aſſigned, why a Prohibition ſhould not be grantable to the Court of Chancery, when by <hi>Engliſh</hi> Bill it med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles with the Common-Law, in other manner than its Ancient and proper Juriſdiction doth allow, and ſeveral Authorities were Cited to countenance that Aſſertion.</p>
            <p>Then was conſidered the reaſon of Prohibitions in general, that they were to preſerve the right of the King's Crown and Courts, and the eaſe and quiet of the Subject, that 'twas the Wiſdom and Policy of the Law, to ſuppoſe both beſt preſerved, when every thing runs in its right Channel, according to the Original Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of every Court, that by the ſame reaſon one Court might be allowed to incroach, another might, which could produce nothing but confuſion and diſorder in the Adminiſtration of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice; that in all other Writs of Prohibition, the ſuggeſtion is and with Truth, <hi>in prejudicium corone Regis &amp; Gravamen partis,</hi> and both theſe are declared to be the conſequent of this Courts exceſs or incroachment of Juriſdiction, even by their own Statutes: and, when the reaſon is the ſame, the remedy ought to be ſo:
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:50172:39"/>But, it hath been pretended, That the Statute appoints a Privy Seal for to ſuperſede, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and therefore no Prohibition; to this it was anſwered, That this Act doth not take away the force of the 8 <hi>Rich.</hi> II. mentio ned in 4 <hi>Inſt.</hi> 125. which reſtrains the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable and Marſhal from medling with any Plea, which concerns the Common Law, and if it had a limitted Juriſdiction by the Common-Law, or by that Statute, the ſubſequent Statute which gave a further Remedy for to reſtrain them, did not take away that which they had before; and every Body muſt agree, that where an Act of Parliament reſtrains a Juriſdiction, ſuch Act warrants a Prohibition, in caſe that reſtraint be broken or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded; 'tis ſo in caſe of a limited Power at the Common Law, but much more ſo upon a Statute.</p>
            <p>Beſides, the latter Statute which gives a Privy Seal, doth not Repeal or alter the Law then in being, 'tis an Affirmative Law, and that ſeldom or never works any change or alteration in what was before, any otherwiſe then by Addition or Confirmation; and in truth this is only a further remedy, and is far from declaring a Prohibition not to lie: the meaning might be to give a Privy Seal immediately, even in vacation time; the preamble complains ſo much of the Grievances, that it cannot be ſuppoſed to Deſign any thing in favour of them, or to prevent the reſtraint.</p>
            <p>Suppoſe between the 8 and the 15 <hi>Rich.</hi> II. an exceſs of Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction had been uſurped as in this Caſe, will any Man ſay, that a Prohibition would not then have lain; and if it would, can any Man ſay, that the Statute pleaded, doth take it away, or Prohibit ſuch Writ of Prohibition: And the 11 <hi>Hen.</hi> IV. 24. ordains that all the Statutes concerning the Court of Conſtable and Marſhal, ſhall be duly obſerved; and if ſo, the 8 <hi>Rich.</hi> II. as well as the 15 <hi>Rich.</hi> II. are within that ordinance; and if ſo, a Prohibition lies as well as a Privy Seal; and both are little enough to keep that Court within its due bounds and limits.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It was argued, That the proceeding upon theſe Articles, was an intermedling with a ſubject matter properly determinable at Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Law; here's no contract or deed of Arms, no Miſ-behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our in War, nothing of that nature, which their own Statute ſays belongs to them: <hi>Ruſhworth</hi>'s II. Vol. 1054. he frequented the Court for four years together, he obſerved no Caſes there but for Words, and one or two as <hi>Delaware</hi>'s Caſe, about abuſing an Honourable Family, by aſſuming to be a branch thereof; here's no ſuch thing, but expreſs Articles for exerciſing of a lawful Trade; 'tis not <hi>cauſa armorum,</hi> it doth neither concern Warlike mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, nor Honour; a Funeral Ceremony can never be within their Power; this is a plain Accuſation for a wrong to one of their Officers; the Articles charge, that Sir <hi>Henry S. George</hi> by his Office within his Province, hath the ordering of theſe matters, and the party hath medled therein without his Licenſe; he ſays, 'tis law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and the exerciſe of a lawful employment; they ſay, 'tis o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, becauſe it belongs to another Man's Office; then 'twas
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:50172:39"/>admitted by the Council for the preſent to be ſo, that Sir <hi>Henry</hi> was an Officer by Letters Patents under the Great Seal of <hi>England,</hi> (which by the way, makes the Office and rights of it to be of Common-Law Conuſance) and the Patent is ſet forth at large in <hi>Prinne,</hi> on 4 <hi>Inſt.</hi> 64, 65. and that the King at Arms hath ſuch a right, yet if any Man intermeddles or incroaches upon that Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice; 'tis not a breach of the rules of Honour, and not relating to Arms, but a plain injury at Common-Law, and an Action lies for it, as it doth for the diſturbance of any other Office or Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſe.</p>
            <p>In 4 <hi>Inſt.</hi> 126. 'tis ſaid, that they do upon requeſt Marſhal Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals, but ſuppoſing they alone ought to do it, then an Action lies: This is merely a queſtion, whether the Letters Patents do carry ſuch a ſole priviledge, ſuppoſe <hi>nul tiel record</hi> be Pleaded to them, when Pleaded or Inrolled, and without producing them, ſuppoſe <hi>non conceſſit</hi> Pleaded to them when produced, how ſhall theſe iſſues be tried: Suppoſe they awarded a ſatisfaction to be made to Sir <hi>H. S.</hi> by the gift of a Summ of Money; and he ſhould afterwards bring an Action at Law for the ſame Cauſe, will the proceeding in the Court of the Earl Marſhal be a barr: the Fact alledged in theſe Articles comes within none of thoſe particulars ſuppoſed to be belonging to this Court, in 1 <hi>Inſt.</hi> 391.</p>
            <p>It matters not, whether theſe were publick Funerals as was que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioned in <hi>Parker</hi>'s Caſe, <hi>Sid.</hi> 352. and in 2 <hi>Keble.</hi> 316.322. but the Query here is, if this be a point of Honour, or whether it be not about the right of an Office; and if it be the latter, they have no Power to determine it.</p>
            <p>The Heralds are Officers attendant upon that Court, but it doth not follow, that that Court can judge of the nature or extent va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidity or operation of their Letters Patents; no more than the Court Chriſtian can try the right or Freehold of a Chancellors or Regiſters Office. The Earl Marſhal cannot Licenſe the doing this in prejudice of the Heralds, or acquit the party if does it, for he ſtill ſtands liable at Law; the Herald hath a Freehold in it, and may bring his Action notwithſtanding.</p>
            <p>Then, 3. 'Twas argued, that admitting that no Prohibition did lie to the Court of Honour, or that there was no cauſe for ſuch Prohibition, yet it ought to be granted to this pretended Court, which is not within their Statute. The true Court is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Conſtable and Marſhal, it is a Court by Preſcription, and cannot be altered but by Act of Parliament: All our Books which deſcribe the Court, mention it to be before both, 4 <hi>Inſt.</hi> 125. <hi>Crompt.</hi> Juriſdiction, 82. 1 <hi>Inſt.</hi> 74. <hi>Stamford.</hi> 65. The Conſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble is the Chief, and ſo are the Old Books, and 37 <hi>Hen.</hi> 6.20. expreſly before the Conſtable and Marſhal. The Statutes which mention the Court, do all take notice of it, as held before both: the 8 <hi>Rich.</hi> 2. and that which they Plead, do deſcribe it ſo: and
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:50172:40"/>the 1 <hi>Hen.</hi> 4. <hi>Cap.</hi> 14. the 13 <hi>Hen.</hi> 4.4.5. all Attainders are Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to be before both.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cambden</hi> (who was an Herald) in his Commentary <hi>de Etymolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gio, antiquitate &amp; officio Comitis Mareſchalli Angliae,</hi> fol. 87. 'tis pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed at the end of his Latin Epiſtles, which are in 4to, Printed for <hi>Chiſwell,</hi> 1691. he endeavours to advance the Office of Earl Marſhal, and ſearches for the Etymology, and after all, makes him but an Harbinger, and tells us when the Title <hi>Mareſchallus Angliae</hi> was firſt uſed, and how it hath been enjoyed, and by whom, and of what Families, and afterwards 91. leſſens his Character much, and derives the Office of Marſhal of <hi>England</hi> from that of Marſhal of the Houſhold, which he deſcribes to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage, the ſame is likewiſe in <hi>Fleta. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 5.</p>
            <p>But this is obſervable, which <hi>Cambden</hi> ſays, that the greateſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of the Authority of this Office hath been, ſince there were no Conſtables, for the Kings ſince that time have referred many things to them, which in former times were proper for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable; neither had the Marſhal any precedency in reſpect of his place, until King <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. <hi>Anno</hi> 31. by Parliament Aſſigned him place next to the Lord Conſtable and before the Lord Admiral: all which, ſhews that the Earl Marſhal never had that Authority time out of mind, to hold this Court before himſelf alone, as is pretended, during the vacancy of the Office of Conſtable.</p>
            <p>In <hi>November,</hi> 1640. 'twas Voted by the Houſe of Commons, upon a report from a Committee of ſome of the greateſt Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Houſe, <hi>Selden, Hollis, Maynard, Palmer, Hide,</hi> &amp;c. that the Earl Marſhal can make no Court without the Conſtable, and that the Earl Marſhal's Court is a grievance, <hi>Ruſhworth</hi> 2 Vol. 1056. <hi>Nalſon</hi>'s 1 Vol. 778.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Spelman</hi> in his Gloſſary, <hi>verbo Mareſchallus,</hi> ſeems to ſay, 'twas <hi>officium primo Servile,</hi> and that he was a meer Servant to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable, and gives much ſuch another account of it, as <hi>Cambden</hi> doth: and pag. 403. is an Abſtract or rather Tranſcript of all that is in the Red Book in the Exchequer about the nature of this Office; and there 'tis ſaid, that if the King be in War, then the Conſtable and Marſhal ſhall hold Pleas, and the Marſhal ſhall have the Amerciaments and Forefeitures of all thoſe, who do break the Commandments of the Conſtable and Marſhal; and then it was further alledged, by the Councel for the Defendant, in the Writ of Error, that they knew of no Statute, Record, or Ancient Book of Law or Hiſtory, that ever mentioned the Earl Marſhal alone, as having Power to hold a Court by himſelf: So that taking it as a Court, held before an incompetent Judge, a Prohibition ought to go, and the Party ought not to be put to his Action, after he has undergone impriſonment and paid his Fine, ſince it hath the ſemblance of a Court, and pretends to act as ſuch; and if it be a Court before the Earl Marſhal alone, in caſe it exceeds the Juriſdiction proper to it, a Prohibition lies ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by force of the Common-Law, which ſtates the boundaries and limits of that Juriſdiction, or by force of the Statute of 8
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:50172:40"/>
               <hi>Rich.</hi> 2. which is not repealed by the ſubſequent Law in that Reign, and if ſuch Prohibition do lie in any Caſe, that here was cauſe for it, the ſubject matter of the Articles being only a wrong (if any) to a private Officer, who had his proper remedy at the Common-Law; and therefore it was prayed that the Judgment ſhould be affirmed, and it was affirmed.</p>

            <p>APpeal from a Decree of Diſmiſſion made by the Lord <hi>Jeffreys,</hi> the Bill was to compel the Dean and Chapter, as Lord of the Mannor to receive a Petition in nature of a Writ of falſe Judgment, for Reverſing a common recovery ſuffered in the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor Court, in 1652. whereby a Remainder in Tail, under which, the Plaintiff claimed was barred, ſuggeſting ſeveral Errors in the proceeding therein: And that the ſaid Lord might be comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to examine the ſame, and do Right thereupon.</p>
            <p>To this Bill, the Defendant <hi>Rugle</hi> demurred, and the Dean and Chapter by Anſwer, inſiſted, That 'twas the firſt Attempt of this kind, and of dangerous conſequence, and therefore conceived it not fit to proceed on the ſaid Petition, unleſs compelled there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to by courſe of Law: That <hi>Rugle</hi> being the Perſon concerned in intereſt to conteſt the ſufficiency of the Common-recovery, they hoped the Court would hear his defence, and determine therein before any Judgment were given againſt them, and that they were only Lords of the Mannor, and ready to Obey, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and prayed that their rights might be preſerved: This demurrer was heard and ordered to ſtand.</p>
            <p>And now it was inſiſted on by the Council with the Appellant, that this was the only Remedy which they had, that no Writ of Error or falſe Judgment lies for Reverſing of a recovery or Judgment obtained in a Copyhold Court, that the only method was a Bill or Petition to the Lord, in nature of a Writ of falſe Judgment, which of common right he ought to receive, and to cauſe Errors and defects in ſuch recovery or Judgment to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined, and for this were Cited <hi>Moore</hi> 68. <hi>Owen</hi> 63. <hi>Fitſ.

<pb n="68" facs="tcp:50172:41"/>Then it was argued, That in all Caſes where any Party having a Right to any Freehold Eſtate, is barred by Judgment, Recovery, or Fine, ſuch Party of common Right may have a Writ of Error, if the ſame be in a Court of Record; and a Writ of falſe Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, if in a Court Baron or County Court, and reverſe ſuch Judgment, Recovery, or Fine for Error or Defect: and there can be no reaſon aſſigned why a Copyholder (eſpecially conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the great quantity of Land of that Tenure in <hi>England</hi>) ſhould be without remedy, when a falſe Judgment is given; and the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for that in Real Actions (as this was) the Proceedings in the Lord's Courts are according to thoſe in <hi>Weſtminſter-hall;</hi> and now tho' a Common Recovery be a Common Aſſurance, yet it was never pretended that a Writ of Error to Reverſe it was refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed upon that pretence; and if the Lord of a Mannor deny to do his Duty, the <hi>Chancery</hi> hath ſuch a Superiour Juriſdiction as to enjoyn him thereto. 'Tis the Buſineſs of Equity to ſee that Right be done to all Suitors in Copyhold Courts, <hi>Fitsh. Abridg. Subpena</hi> 21. 2 <hi>Cro.</hi> 368. 2 <hi>Bulstr.</hi> 336. 1 <hi>Rolls Abridg.</hi> 373. If an Erroneous Judgment be given in ſuch Court of a common Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon's, in an Action in the Nature of a <hi>Formedon,</hi> a Bill may be in <hi>Chancery</hi> in nature of a falſe Judgment to Reverſe it; and <hi>Lanc.</hi> 38. <hi>Tanfield</hi> ſays that he was of Counſel in the Caſe of <hi>Patteſhall,</hi> and that it was ſo decreed, which is much more then what is here contended for; and tho' Common Recoveries are favoured, and have been ſupported by ſeveral Acts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; yet no Parliament ever thought fit to deprive the Parties bound by ſuch Recoveries, of the benefit of a Writ of Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror.</p>
            <p>On the other ſide, 'twas urged in defence of the Diſmiſſion, That the Perſon who ſuffered this Recovery had a power over the Eſtate, that ſhe might both by Law and Conſcience, upon a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, diſpoſe of it, as ſhe ſhould think fit; that ſhe hath ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered a Recovery, and that it was ſuffered according to the cuſtom of the Mannor, tho' not according to the form of thoſe ſuffered in <hi>Weſtminster-hall:</hi> That the ſuffering of Recoveries in any Court, and the Methods of proceeding in them, are rather notional then real things; and in the Common Law Courts they are taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of, not as Adverſary Suits, but as Common Aſſurances; ſo that even there, few Miſtakes are deemed ſo great, but what are remedied by the Statute of Jeofailes, or will be amended by the Aſſiſtance of the Court: And if it be ſo in the Courts at <hi>Weſtmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> where the Proceedings are more ſolemn, and the Judges are Perſons of Learning and Sagacity, how much rather ought this to ſtand, which was ſuffered in 1652. during the Times of Diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and moſt Proceedings informal and in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tongue, in ſuch a mean Court where are few Precedents to guide them: where the Parties themſelves are not empowered to draw up their own Proceedings as here above; but the whole is left to the Steward, who is a Stranger to the Perſon concerned; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:50172:41"/>'tis hard and unreaſonable, that Mens Purchaſes ſhould be prejudiced by the Ignorance, Unskilfulneſs, or Diſhoneſty of a Steward or his Clerks; that there is ſcarce one Cuſtomary Reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very in <hi>England,</hi> which is exactly agreeable to the Rules of the Common Law; that the queſtioning of this, may in conſequence endanger multitudes of Titles which have been honeſtly purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, eſpecially ſince there can be no aid from the Statutes of Jeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>failes, for they do not extend to Courts Baron. 'Twas further urged, That there was no Precedent to enforce Lords of Mannors to do as this Bill deſired; that the Lords of Mannors are the ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate Judges of the Regularity or Errours in ſuch Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; that there's no Equity in the Prayer of this Plaintiff; that if the Lord had received ſuch Petition, and were about to proceed to the Reverſal of ſuch Recovery, Equity ought then to interpoſe and quiet the Poſſeſſion under thoſe Recoveries: That <hi>Chancery</hi> ought rather to ſupply a Defect in a Common Conveyance (if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſhall happen) and decree the Execution of what each Party meant and intended by it, much rather, than to aſſiſt the annul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of a Solemn Agreement, executed according to Uſage, tho' not ſtrictly conformable to the Rules of Law. For which Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons it was prayed that that Appeal might be diſmiſſed, and the Diſmiſſion below confirmed, and 'was accordingly adjudged ſo.</p>

            </head>
            <p>APpeal from a Decree of Diſmiſſion in <hi>Chancery,</hi> the Caſe was to this effect; The Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi> upon Marriage of his Son, ſettles part of his Eſtate upon his Lady for a Jointure, and after failure of Iſſue Male, limits a Term for 99 years to Truſtees to be diſpoſed of by the Earl, either by Deed or Will: And for want of ſuch Appointment, then in truſt for the next in Remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and then limited the whole Eſtate in ſuch manner, as that a third part of a Moiety thereof came to the Lord <hi>Bodmyn</hi> (the Appellants late Husband) in Tail general, with the Reverſion in Fee to the Earl and his Heirs. The Son died without Iſſue, the Earl by his Will appoints the Lands to his Counteſs for ſo many years of the Term as ſhe ſhould live, and to her Executors for one year after her Death, and charges the Term with ſeveral Annui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, ſome of which remain in being. The Reſpondent's Father purchaſed part of theſe Lands from the Lord <hi>Bodmyn</hi> after his Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, and had the Term aſſigned to him. The Lord <hi>Bodmyn</hi> dyes, the Appellant brings her Writ of Dower in <hi>C. B.</hi> the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondent pleads the Term for 99 years; and ſhe Exhibits her
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:50172:42"/>Bill, praying that ſhe may, after the diſcharge of the Earls Incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brances, have the benefit of the Truſt as to a third of the Profits of this Term; and upon hearing the Cauſe, the Lord Chancellor ſaw no cauſe to give Relief, but diſmiſſed her Bill. There were many Particulars in the Caſe, and many Proceedings before, both in Law and Equity; but this was the whole Caſe as to the general Queſtion, Whether a Tenant in Dower ſhall have the benefit of the Truſt of a Term which is ordered to attend the Inheritance, againſt a Purchaſer after the Marriage? The Lord Chancellor <hi>Jeffryes</hi> had been of opinion with the Appellant, but the Cauſe coming to be heard again, a Diſmiſſion was decreed, and now it was argued againſt the Decree on behalf of the Appellant, that E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity did entitle her to the Thirds of this Term; that a Tenant by the Curteſie is intitled to it, and br the ſame reaſon a Tenant in Dower; that the Term created by the Settlement, was to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend all the Eſtates limited by that Settlement, and in Truſt for ſuch Perſons as ſhould claim under it, which the Appellant doth as well as the Reſpondents; that it was in conſequence to attend all the particular Eſtates carved or derived from the others; the Term was never in its creation deſigned for this purpoſe, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent or protect againſt Dower; that in the Caſe of <hi>Snell</hi> and <hi>Clay,</hi> the Tenant in Dower had it in <hi>Chancery</hi> againſt the Heir at Law, and that this was the ſame Caſe, a Purchaſer with notice of that Incumbrance of Dower, the Vendor being then married; this was an Eſtate of which the Husband was full Owner, and received the whole Profits; that in proportion, 'tis as much a Truſt for her, for her Thirds during Life, as it is a Truſt for the Reſpondents for the Inheritance; ſhe claims under her Husband who had the benefit of the whole Truſt: If there be a Mortgage by an Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtor upon the whole Eqinty will permit her to redeem, paying her proportion, according to the value of her Thirds for Life; and the ſame reaſon holds in this Caſe; and there's no Precedent in Equity to the contrary: And many Precedents in favour of Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant in Dower were cited, and much Reaſon well urged from pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel Caſes, to entitle the Lady to her proportion of the Truſt of this Term.</p>
            <p>On the other ſide, 'Twas ſaid that Dower is an Intereſt or Right at the Common Law only; that no Title can be maintained to have Dower, but where the Common Law gives it, and that is only to have the Thirds of that which the Husband was ſeized of; and if a Term were in being, no Feme was ever let in but after the determination of that Term; that this is the firſt pretence ſet up for a Dower in Equity; the Right is only to the Thirds of the Rent reſerved upon any Term; and 'tis a new thing to affirm, that there ſhall be one ſort of Dower at Law, and another in <hi>Chancery;</hi> that 'tis, and always hath been, the common received Opinion of <hi>Weſtminſter-hall,</hi> and of all Conveyancers, that a Term or Statute prevents Dower, that if a Purchaſer can procure it, the ſame becomes his Defence; that this is what the Wiſdom of our
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:50172:42"/>Forefathers thought fit to uſe, and tho' ſome Mens reaſoning may render it in appearance as abſurd, yet the conſequence of an alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration will be much more dangerous than the continuance of the old Rules; that tho' this Lady's Caſe be unfortunate, yet the multitude of Purchaſors, who have bought upon full conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and have been adviſed, and ſtill conceive themſelves ſafe under this Law, will be more unfortunate, if the Law be broken. Then 'was argued, That there could be no Equity in this Caſe, for it muſt be not only from the Party Appellant, but alſo againſt the Reſpondent, and that 'tis not, becauſe he bought the whole: Her Portion, her Quality, and her being a Wife, create no Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty as to the Purchaſer, 'twould perhaps be prevalent againſt an Heir, but not againſt him: here's no Fraud or ill Practiſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Then if the nature of the thing be conſidered, the Demand is of a Right, not ariſing by Agreement of Parties, but by Operation of Law; if the former, <hi>Chancery</hi> might perhaps conſtrue and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large it, ſo as to fulfil the utmoſt Intention: but here, her title is the Marriage, the Seiſin, and Death of the Husband: And there never was a time when, if her Lord had died, ſhe could have had immediate Dower, for even the Term had been pleadable by an Heir of Law to a Writ of Dower: Now what doth give her an Equity againſt the Reſpondent? Her Claim is by, from, and under her Husband, as having a Right to a Proportion of what he had, that is a Right by the Law: where is the Equity that ſhould improve or mend this Right? Perhaps it muſt be agreed, That if the Husband had juſt before Marriage made a long Leaſe on purpoſe to prevent Dower, and the Woman expecting the Priviledges which the Common Law gives to Women married, had ſurviv'd him, Equity might have interpoſed; and yet even this was practiſed by a Reverend Judge of Equity, Mr. Serjeant <hi>May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard,</hi> who made ſuch Leaſe to his Man <hi>Bradford,</hi> the day before his laſt Marriage: but here is no ſuch Action, 'twas an old Term created by the old Earl of <hi>Warwick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to the Caſe of the Mortgages, The Feme intituled to Dower is let in, becauſe the Perſon who is the Mortgagee hath no Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt but to have his Money; and Equity is to execute all theſe A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greements, but never where there is a Purchaſer, or where the Intereſt of the Mortgage is aſſigned to the Heire: Between her ſelf and the Mortgagee, ſhe comes in place of her Husband, and the Husband could redeem, and ſo may the Wife; but againſt a Purchaſer ſhe has no more Equity then her Husband had, and that is none at all. If ſhe hath a Legal Title antecedent to the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſers, as Marriage and Seiſin, where there's no Term ſtanding out, that ſhall prevail, and Equity ſhall not help the Purchaſer againſt her: ſo where the Purchaſer hath a Legal Title as by a Term precedent, Equity cannot relieve her. And whereas it was objected, That there was no Caſe adjudged in <hi>Chancery</hi> againſt the Appellants pretence; the Anſwer is plain, The Common Law is againſt it; and if no Precedent in Equity, the Common Law ought to ſtand: 'Tis nothing but Precedent that Conſecrates half
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:50172:43"/>the Decrees in Equity: And no Man will ſay, that ever any Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man was endowed in Equity of a Truſt Eſtate. If a Man hath a Term for Ten thouſand years, and be entirely and properly own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of it, tho' the ſame be equal in value to a Feeſimple, for the Reverſion after it is worth little or nothing, yet no Dower can be claimed in Equity; nay, If the Husband be ſeized together with another Perſon, and not ſole ſeized, yet no Dower, even in <hi>Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery,</hi> can be claimed againſt the Survivor: So that Equity doth not exceed the Rules of Law in advancing the Right of Dower. 'Tis true, unleſs Fraud be in the Caſe, (according to the Caſe of <hi>Naſh</hi> and <hi>Preſton</hi> in <hi>Cro. Car.</hi> 190, 191.) Relief in Equity ſhall not be given againſt a Legal Title to Dower; yet 'tis as true, that where the Law doth not give Dower, Equity will not, unleſs there be Fraud and Covin uſed to prevent it, and then common Reaſon enjoyns a Court of Conſcience to Relieve. If any Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance had been in the Purchaſe, upon Conſideration of the Title to Dower, the ſame would have been a very material Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but in this Caſe there was none: And therefore 'twas pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that the Diſmiſſion might be affirmed, and it was ſo.</p>

            <p>WRit of Error, to Reverſe a Judgment given in the Court of <hi>Exchequer,</hi> and affirmed upon a Writ of Error in the Councel Chamber before the Chancellor, with the Aſſiſtance of the two Chief Juſtices. The Caſe upon the Record was only this; One <hi>Allen</hi> outlaws one <hi>Clerk</hi> in Debt on a Bond in <hi>Mich.</hi> 1690. on the Seventh of <hi>Jan.</hi> 1690. by virtue of a Special <hi>Capias utlagatum,</hi> and inquiſition thereupon, ſeizes <hi>Clerk</hi>'s Lands into their Majeſties hand. In <hi>Hillary</hi> Term following the Outlawry and Inquiſition are certified into the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> and <hi>Allen</hi> obtains a Leaſe under a Rent. In <hi>Mich.</hi> 1692. <hi>Baden</hi> comes and pleads that in <hi>Mich.</hi> 4 <hi>Jac.</hi> 2. he recovered a Judgment againſt <hi>Clerk</hi> for 1080 <hi>l.</hi> that in <hi>Trinity</hi> Term 1691. he took out an <hi>Elegit,</hi> and had a Moiety of the Lands extended, and therefore prays that an <hi>amoveas manus</hi> may be awarded. Mr. Attorney replies, That the Lands were ſeized by virtue of the Outlawry and Inquiſition long before the <hi>Elegit</hi> was ſued, and therefore, <hi>&amp;c. Baden</hi> demurs, and Judgment for the King.</p>
            <p>It was argued on behalf of the Plaintiff in the Writ of Error, that this Judgment was Erroneous, for that there's a vaſt diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between an Outlawry in a Civil, and one in a Criminal Proceſs: That in a Civil Action, 'tis only a Civil Proceſs for the benefit of the Party; and 5 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 12. the King cannot par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don an Outlawry at the Suit of a private Perſon; that 'tis only to help one Subject to his Debt from another; that the King hath
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:50172:43"/>no Advantage by it, and ſo no need of a Preference by reaſon of the Prerogative; that at Common Law no Man could be outlawed; that now it is purely given for the ſake of the Plaintiff; that the common Practiſe is to make a Leaſe, or grant a privy Seal to the Party: That by this Outlawry the King hath no Intereſt in the Land; he cannot cut down the Trees, 9 <hi>H.</hi> 6.20. that he cannot Plow or Sow; but only collect and receive the Profits which ariſe out of the Land, <hi>Bro. tit. Outlawry</hi> 36. <hi>tit. Patents</hi> 3. that the King hath not the poſſeſſion of the Land, which ſhews it not to be a Forfeiture to the King, but it remains the Parties ſtill, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of Ownerſhip, he may make a Feoffment, 21 <hi>Hen.</hi> 7.7. 2 <hi>Inſt.</hi> 675. <hi>Hob.</hi> 122. by the Judgment the Lands were bound, tho' the Title was not compleat, till the <hi>Elegit</hi> was ſued out; a <hi>monſtrans de droit</hi> or Petition did lye, and now the ſame Matter may be pleaded. 'Twas further argued, That great Miſchief muſt follow, if an Outlawry upon Civil Proceſs may defeat a Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; that Judgments with releaſe of Errors are taken and uſed as common Securities; that this is moſt plainly a device to avoid them; that this can be no Security, if an <hi>Elegit</hi> may not be ſued, but prevented by the Party himſelf, for here it is his own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fault, not to avoid this Outlawry by Appearance; that no act of the Debtor could alter the Security, and there's no reaſon why his neglect ſhould: that this Conteſt is between <hi>Baden</hi> and <hi>Allen;</hi> and not between <hi>Baden</hi> and the King. <hi>Allen</hi>'s Suit was but juſt begun, and this is meerly upon his Suit; If the Perſon had been taken upon this <hi>Capias,</hi> he had been the Plaintiff's priſoner; and if he Eſcapes the Plaintiff had an Action for it, <hi>Yelv.</hi> 19. and the ſuppoſed Forfeiture is only for his Intereſt, 3 <hi>Cro.</hi> 909. And by this practiſe the King's Prerogative is to aſſiſt one Subject to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive another: By the Law a Judgment is preferrable to a Bond, and binds the Land, which a Bond doth not till Judgment upon it; now here the firſt is to be poſtponed, by reaſon of the King's ſuppoſed Prerogative, which is only a Right in the King, for the uſe of the Party to have the Profits, 2 <hi>Rolls Abridg.</hi> 808. <hi>vide Stamford</hi> 57. 1 <hi>Inſt.</hi> 30. <hi>&amp; Hardres.</hi> 101, 176. 1 <hi>Inſt.</hi> 202. <hi>Latch.</hi> 43. That the <hi>Elegit</hi> hath Relation to the Judgment, and ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes Prior to the King's Title, like the Relation of a Bargain and Sale to an Inrolment; and as a ſtrong Argument for it, the words in the Writ of <hi>Elegit</hi> were repeated and enforced, <hi>quo die Jud' red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit' fuit,</hi> which ſhewed a relation to that day; and conſequently did affect the Lands at a time when the King had no Intereſt in it.</p>
            <p>On the other ſide, it was argued with the Judgment, That this was the common Practiſe of the Court of <hi>Exchequer</hi> in this Caſe, that the Courſe of a Court is the Law of that Court, and to be taken notice of by all other Courts, that 'tis time out of mind, and conſequently of equal duration with the Common Law, and always deemed to be parcel thereof; that the Records and Experience of the ancient Clerks were both concurring to prove it the common U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage in the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> that when Lands are ſeized into the K's hands by virtue of an Outlawry and Inquiſition, it was never known that
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:50172:44"/>the King's hands, were removed by force of an <hi>Elegit</hi> ſued after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, tho' upon a Judgment precedent; that it hath been their conſtant practiſe to continue the pernancy of the Profits in the King, notwithſtanding ſuch <hi>Elegit;</hi> that 'twould be of dangerous Conſequence to alter the ſame by a new Opinion; that 'tis not ſo very material, whether this practiſe be more reaſonable then ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but whether it be certain and known? for if it be ſo, 'tis much better to have it continued then changed, becauſe of the Confuſion which muſt follow, by ſhaking the Rights and Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions enjoyed under the former Practiſe: That 'tis not in many Caſes ſo conſiderable what the Rule is, as that it be fixed and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood; and therefore no reaſon to alter it, or at leaſt not without the uſe of the Legiſlature; for by the ſame colour that ſome Judges of Parts and Segacity ſhall think fit to ſwerve from their Predeceſſors, others of leſs capacity may pretend to do the ſame, and ſo nothing but uncertainty would enſue.</p>
            <p>But beſides, this is not meerly a Courſe of the Court, 'tis alſo agreeable to the Rule and Reaſon of the Laws; <hi>Baden</hi> hath no intereſt in the Land 'till he ſues his <hi>Elegit;</hi> whereas the King's Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to the Land was compleat by the Outlawry and Inquiſition, which was prior to the <hi>Elegit;</hi> and a Judgment of it ſelf doth not affect the Land, till Election made; a Judgment at Law is only an Award of the Court aſcertaining of the Debt, and declaring that the Plaintiff ſhall recover. In it ſelf it doth no more aſſect the Land, then a Bond; 'tis true, when the Suit is ended by a Judgment, the Party may reſort to an <hi>Elegit</hi> for his Execution, if he thinks fit, and can find any thing ſubject thereto. At the Common Law, before the Statute of <hi>Weſtminst</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 18. a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject upon his Judgment for Debt or Damages, could not have Execution by taking away the Poſſeſſion of his Adverſary's Land, becauſe that would hinder the Man's following of Husbandry and Tillage, which then was reckoned beneficial to the Publick: So is 2 <hi>Inſt.</hi> 394. and Sir <hi>William Herbert</hi>'s Caſe, 3 <hi>Rep.</hi> 11, 12. no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a <hi>Levari</hi> or <hi>Fieri facias;</hi> then by the Statute, <hi>ſit in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectione illius,</hi> and <hi>Coke</hi> in his Comment on thoſe words, ſaith, After the ſuing of an <hi>Elegit,</hi> he can't have a <hi>Capias:</hi> So that by him, the ſuing out of the Writ, is the determining of his Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, 2 <hi>Inst.</hi> 395. <hi>Foſter</hi> and <hi>Jackson</hi>'s Caſe, <hi>Hob.</hi> 57. Even the <hi>Elegit</hi> it ſelf doth not (when ſued out) immediately touch the Lands; for if that the Chattels be ſufficient to pay the Debt, and it ſo appears to the Sheriff, that thereby he may ſatisfie the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiffs Demand, then he ought not to extend the Land; and this appears by the frame of the Writ, as 'tis in the <hi>Regiſter</hi> 299. 2 <hi>Inſt.</hi> 395. which ſhews that no Title can be acquired to the Land, till the ſame be Extended.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Elegit</hi> cannot by Law have relation to the Time of the Judgment, ſo as to avoid the King's Title; for relation is only a Fiction, and Fiction ſhall never bind or prejudice the King in his Right, much leſs in his Prerogative; and no Caſe can be ſhewn, where a Relation ſhall conclude the King:
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:50172:44"/>nor is it any Objection, That this is a Prerogative for the Benefit of a Subject; for in truth, all the Prerogatives are for the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage and Good of the People, or elſe they ought not to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by the Law. Beſides Practiſe and Reaſon, there's expreſs Authority in our Books for it, as the Caſe of <hi>Maſters</hi> verſus Sir <hi>Herbert Whitfield</hi> 1657. <hi>Hardres.</hi> 106. And if there were no Book for it, the Practiſe is enough; for the printing of a Caſe doth not alter or change the nature of it: 'tis as much Authority if it be not publiſhed, as when it is ſo: <hi>Maſters</hi> recovered a Judgment againſt Sir <hi>Herbert Whitfield,</hi> and after the Judgment Sir <hi>Herbert</hi> was outlawed at another Man's Suit, and his Lands ſeized into the Protector's hands, and afterwards <hi>Maſters</hi> took out an <hi>Elegit,</hi> and the whole Court was of Opinion, that the Lands being ſeized into the Protector's hands before the <hi>Elegit</hi> was ſued out, there could not be an <hi>amoveas manus</hi> awarded, altho' the Judgment was prior to the Outlawry; this is the ſame with the Caſe at Bar; and tho' it may be ſurmiſed, That this was an Opinion vented in Evil Times, yet 'tis well known, that excepting their Criminal Proceedings in thoſe Times, the Law flouriſhed, and the Judges were Men of Learning, as Mr. Juſtice <hi>Twiſden</hi> hath often affirmed upon the Bench. 'Twas further urged, That Prerogative was to be favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; that 'twas a part of the Law, 2 <hi>Inſt.</hi> 296. eſpecially when 'twas uſed, as in this Caſe, to help an honeſt Man to his Debt; that confeſſing of Judgments was oftner practiſed by Fraud to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Mens Eſtates, then Outlawries were to defeat juſt Judgments: That if this Judgment was juſt and honeſt, 'twas his own default, not to ſue an <hi>Elegit</hi> immediately. Then were cited many Caſes to prove the King's Prerogative, as <hi>Fleetwood</hi>'s Caſe, 8 <hi>Rep.</hi> 171. <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Athen</hi>'s Caſe, <hi>Lane</hi>'s Rep. 20. <hi>Hob.</hi> 115. 2 <hi>Rolls Abridg.</hi> 158. <hi>Stevenſon</hi>'s Caſe, 1 <hi>Cro.</hi> 389, 390. 'Twas argued that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could be inferred from <hi>Tanfield</hi>'s Opinion in 2 <hi>Rolls Abridg.</hi> 159. which is alſo in <hi>Lane</hi>'s <hi>Rep.</hi> 65. for there the Debt was not a Debt to the King, till after the Death of the Teſtator; but here is a Forfeiture to the King before the <hi>Elegit</hi> ſued: and admitting that the King hath only the pernancy of the Profits, yet while he hath ſo, no other Perſon can intermeddle, for the King is intitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to all the Profits, even to a Preſentment to a Church, which was void before the Outlawry, as is <hi>Beverly</hi>'s Caſe, 1 <hi>Leon.</hi> 63. 2 <hi>Rolls Abridg.</hi> 807. and <hi>Oland</hi>'s Caſe, 5 <hi>Rep.</hi> 116. And Proceſs of Outlawry is to be favoured and encouraged, as 'tis a Means for the recovery of juſt Debts; and the effects of them, by Forfeiture to the King, ought to be favoured as a Prerogative, wherewith the King is intruſted to that purpoſe: 'Tis a Penalty or Judgment up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him to be put <hi>Extra Legem,</hi> becauſe he contemns the Law, and will not obey it; ſo that as to him, 'tis the greateſt Juſtice in the World, that he ſhould not enjoy any benefit of his Eſtate by virtue of the Law, during the time that he deſpiſes it. And as to <hi>Baden,</hi> 'twas his own default that he did not extend ſooner; he truſted the Party longer then he ſhould, and for that he may thank himſelf: Wherefore upon the whole, 'twas prayed that the Judgment ſhould be affirmed, and it was affirmed.</p>

            <p>APpeal from a Decree of Diſmiſſion in the Court of <hi>Chancery:</hi> The Caſe was thus; That <hi>Thomas Thynne</hi> Eſq; having in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions to make his Addreſſes to the Lady <hi>Ogle,</hi> gave a Bond of 1000 <hi>l.</hi> Penalty to the Reſpondents Husband to pay 500 <hi>l.</hi> in Ten days after his Marriage with the Lady <hi>Ogle;</hi> the Reſpondent aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in promoting the ſaid Marriage, which afterwards took effect; ſoon after the ſaid <hi>Thynne</hi> was barbarouſly murdered; and about ſix years after Mr. <hi>Potter</hi> brought an Action upon this Bond a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Appellants, as Executors of Mr. <hi>Thynne,</hi> and proving the Marriage, recovered a Verdict for the 1000 <hi>l.</hi> Thereupon the Appellants preferred their Bill in <hi>Chancery</hi> to be relieved againſt this Bond, as given upon an unlawful Conſideration; the Defendants by their Anſwer acknowledge the Promotion of that Marriage to be the Reaſon of giving the Bond. Upon hearing the Cauſe at the <hi>Rolls,</hi> the Court decreed the Bond to be delivered up, and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction to be acknowledged upon the Judgment. The Reſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent petitioned the Lord Keeper for a re-hearing; and the ſame being re-heard accordingly, his Lordſhip was pleaſed to Reverſe that Decree, and ordered the Reſpondents to pay Principal, Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt and Coſts, or elſe the Bill to ſtand diſmiſt with Coſts.</p>
            <p>And it was argued on behalf of the Appellants, That this Bond ought in equity to be ſet aſide, for that even at the Common Law, Bonds founded upon unlawful Conſiderations appearing in the condition were void; that in many Inſtances, Bonds and Contracts that are good at Law, and cannot be avoided there, are cancelled in Equity: That ſuch Bonds to Match-makers and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curers of Marriage are of dangerous Conſequence, and tend to the betraying, and oftentimes to the ruin of Perſons of Quality and Fortune: And if the uſe of ſuch Securities and Contracts be allowed and countenanced, the ſame may prove the occaſion of many unhappy Marriages, to the prejudice and diſcomfort of the beſt of Families; that the Conſideration of ſuch Bonds and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curities have always been diſcountenanced, and Relief in Equity given againſt them, even ſo long ſince as the Lord <hi>Coventry</hi>'s time, and long before; and particularly in the Caſe of <hi>Arundel</hi> and <hi>Trevilian;</hi> betweeen whom the Fourth of <hi>February,</hi> 11 <hi>Car.</hi> 1. was an Order made in theſe, or the like words: <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon the hearing and debating of the Matter this preſent day in the preſence of the Counſel Learned, on both ſides, for and touching the Bond or Bill of</hi> 100 <hi>l. against which the Plaintiff by his Bill prayeth relief. It appeared that the ſaid Bill was originally entred into by the Plaintiff unto the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant for the payment of</hi> 100 <hi>l. formerly promiſed unto the ſaid
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:50172:45"/>Defendant by the Plaintiff, for the effecting of a Marriage between the Plaintiff and</hi> Elizabeth <hi>his now Wife, which the ſaid Defendant procured accordingly, as his Counſel alledged. But this Court utterly diſliking the Conſideration whereupon the ſaid Bill was given, the ſame being of dangerous conſequence in precedent, upon reading three ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Precedents, wherein this Court hath relieved others in like Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, againſt Bonds of that nature, thought not fit to give any counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance unto Specialties entred into upon ſuch Contracts: It is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ordered and decreed, That the ſaid Defendant ſhall bring the ſaid Bill into this Court, to be delivered up to the Plaintiff to be cancelled.</hi> Then 'twas further urged, That the Appellants had once a Decree at the <hi>Rolls</hi> to be relieved againſt the Bond in queſtion, upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the ſaid Precedent in the time of the ſaid Lord <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventry</hi> and others; and of the Miſchiefs and Inconveniences like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ariſe by ſuch Practiſes, which increaſe in the preſent Age, more then in the Times when Relief was given againſt ſuch Bonds: and therefore 'twas pray'd that the Decree might be Reverſed.</p>
            <p>On the other ſide it was urged, That the Conſideration of this Bond was lawful; that the aſſiſting and promoting of a Marriage at the Parties requeſt, was a good Conſideration at Law, in all Times, to maintain a Promiſe for payment of Money: That this Bond was voluntary, and the Party who was Obligor was of Age and ſound Memory; that here was no Fraud or Deceit in procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring it; that <hi>Chancery</hi> was not to Relieve againſt Voluntary Acts; that here was a great Fortune to be acquired to the Appellant's Teſtator by the Match; that here was Aſſiſtance given; that the Perſons were both of great Quality and Eſtate, and no Impoſition or Deceit on either ſide in the Marriage: That it might be proper to Relieve againſt ſuch Securities, where ill Conſequences did en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue; yet here being none, and the thing lawful, and the Bond good at Law, the ſame ought to ſtand; that here are no Children Purchaſers or Creditors to be defeated; that there are Aſſets ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to pay all; and conſequently there can be no Injuſtice in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing this Bond to remain in force; that it was the Expectation of the Reſpondent, without which ſhe would not have given her Service in this Matter; and that it was the full meaning of the Appellant's Teſtator to pay this Money, in caſe the Marriage took effect; that there was a vaſt difference between ſupporting and vacating a Contract in <hi>Chancery;</hi> that tho' Equity perhaps would not aſſiſt and help a Security upon ſuch a Conſideration, if it were defective at Law; yet where it was good at Law, and no Cheat or Impoſition upon the Party, but he meant (as he had undertaken) to pay this Money, and was not deceived in his Expectation, as to the Succeſs of the Reſpondent's Endeavours, 'twould be hard in Equity to damn ſuch a Security, and therefore 'twas prayed that the Decree ſhould be affirmed.</p>
            <pb n="78" facs="tcp:50172:46"/>
            <p>It was replied, That Marriages ought to be procured and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted by the Mediation of Friends and Relations, and not of Hirelings; that the not vacating ſuch Bonds, when queſtioned in a Court of Equity, would be of Evil Example to Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, Truſtees, Guardians, Servants, and other People having the Care of Children. And therefore 'twas prayed that the Decree might be reverſed, and it was reverſed accordingly.</p>

            <p>Upon preſenting this Appeal to the Lords here, the Houſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Lords Committees to conſider the proper method of Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealing from the Decrees made in the Court of <hi>Chancery</hi> in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and to report, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Then purſuant to an Order made by the Lords Committees, and a Letter ſent to the Lords Juſtices of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> by Order of the Houſe of Lords here.

By the firſt, it hath all its High Courts and Officers of Juſtice which the King hath; and by the latter, it hath Royal Services, and Royal Eſcheates, as the King hath; and therefore in ſome reſpects, 'tis ſeparated and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned from the Crown, as is <hi>Plowd.</hi> 215. yet 'tis ſubordinate and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant; though it be ſaid, that <hi>breve Dom' Regis non Currit</hi> there, yet the Writ of Error, which is the dernier reſort and in like manner an Appeal, is excepted out of their Charters, ſo is <hi>Dyer</hi> 321. and 345.34 <hi>Hen.</hi> 6.42. and it would be excepted, if it were not ſo expreſſed; for to have the ultimate Judgment, is that which the King cannot grant, for ſuch grant, would (if allowed) alter
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:50172:47"/>the fundamental conſtitution of the Realm. So, in <hi>Ireland,</hi> which is a Realm of it ſelf, as Conſiſting of many Counties, Erroneous Judgments given in the chief place there, ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed in the King's Bench in <hi>England; Davis</hi> quotes <hi>Bracton, lib.</hi> 3. <hi>tit' coron' cap.</hi> 8. that <hi>Comites Palatini habent regalem juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictionem in omnibus, Salvo Dominio Regi ſicut principi;</hi> ſo that by his Opinion, they are much the ſame; and no Man will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, but that in all Proceedings in Law or Equity, the laſt reſort is to the Parliament of <hi>England;</hi> there it is that the King's ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Authority is exercis'd.</p>
            <p>It muſt not be ſaid to be a Conquered Country, for the Earl of <hi>Staſſord</hi>'s ſake, though <hi>Coke</hi> and <hi>Vaughan</hi> have affirmed it ſo: But it may be called a Plantation or Colony, dependant upon <hi>England,</hi> and to many purpoſes, parcel of it. This hath not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the ſame perſon for their King, but 'tis under the Crown and Government of <hi>England;</hi> there muſt be in all theſe Caſes a Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority or ſuperintendency over inferiour Dominions; for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, (as <hi>Vaughan</hi> puts it, 401.) the Law appointed or permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to ſuch places might be inſenſibly changed within it ſelf, without the aſſent of the Dominion Superiour. And, 2. Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments or Decrees might be there made or given to the diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage or of leſſening that Superiority, which cannot be reaſonable, or to make the Superiority to be only in the King, not in the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> (as King <hi>Jac.</hi> 1. would have had it, and conſulted <hi>Selden</hi> upon the point.)</p>
            <p>Now though the Writ of Error be only mentioned, yet the ſame reaſon holds to both; and the true cauſe, why we have not ſo many Ancient precedents of Equity Caſes as of Law ones, is, for that in Ancient time the Equity Courts were not ſo high, meddled with few matters, and in a Summary way; but ſince their Authority is ſo advanced, and their Juriſdiction ſo enlarged, that moſt queſtions of property are become determinable there, and almoſt every ſuit begins or ends with them, to the entire ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of the Old Common-Law. It is and muſt now be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable to have the Examination of their final Sentences in the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> as well as of the other.</p>
            <p>Suppoſe non-reſidence in <hi>Ireland</hi> ſhould be pretended, a For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture of the Eſtate to the next remainder Man or to the King. Can it be ſafe for to intruſt them with a concluſive Opinion in this matter. When <hi>Calais</hi> was in our hands, Writs of Error lay thither, 21 <hi>Hen.</hi> 7. fol. 3. As to the pretence, that the orders of this Houſe cannot be executed there; 'tis very vain, for if the King's Bench Command their Judgments to be executed there; this Houſe may order theirs; and in like manner as they do to the Chancery here.</p>
            <p>In 15 <hi>Rich.</hi> 2. numb. 17. in the Abbot of St. <hi>Oſithe</hi>'s Caſe, the Lords here made an Order, and charged the Lord Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor that he ſee it performed; and this hath been conſtant pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice.</p>
            <pb n="81" facs="tcp:50172:47"/>
            <p>It hath been imagined, That the Juriſdiction of this Houſe in matters of this kind, is dated from the 21 <hi>Jac.</hi> 1. as to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings in <hi>Chancery;</hi> but that is not now to be diſputed; for, the Commons in Parliament Aſſembled, did agree it to be the Right of this Houſe; in the Caſe of <hi>Skinner</hi> and the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; and in the Book about it, ſuppoſed to be written by that Noble Lord, the Lord <hi>Hollis,</hi> 105. 'tis ſaid, that where the King's Sovereign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tydoth not reach, the Juriſdiction of this Houſe cannot; the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is implied, that where the King of <hi>England</hi>'s Sovereignty doth extend, the Juriſdiction of this Houſe doth ſo too; and no Man will affirm, That <hi>Ireland</hi> is out of or beyond the limits of the Sovereignty of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Crown. And as to the exerciſe of this Judicature by the Lords here, nothing can be ſtronger for it, then the 1 <hi>Hen.</hi> 4. numb. 79. So 'tis in the Record, though in <hi>Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>'s <hi>Abridg</hi> 'tis 80. the Commons declare that all Judgments Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertain to the King and Lords, and not to them; <hi>Skinner</hi>'s Caſe, 199, 200. 4 <hi>Inſt.</hi> 349, 353, 354.</p>
            <p>It was further argued, That Protection commands a due Subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and that theſe people who inſiſted upon this independency, had forgot the Engliſh Treaſure and Bloud, which had been ſpent for their preſervation.</p>
            <p>That they are part of <hi>England</hi> and ſubject to its Laws, appears from the common Caſe of an incumbency here, being made void by acceptance of a Biſhoprick in that Colony: Beſides, that in Ancient time the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> was Primate of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and had the Confirmation and Conſecration of Biſhops there, <hi>Cambden</hi>'s <hi>Britt.</hi> pag. 735. and 765. 4 <hi>Inſt.</hi> 360. then 'twas urged that the Queſtion now was, whether it were a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion inferiour, or equal to and independant upon the Realm of <hi>England:</hi> That the conſtant practice had been for the Lords here to examine the Decrees in their Court of <hi>Chancery,</hi> that the refuſing of this Appeal, would ſhake all thoſe Caſes thus deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined; that every Appeal-here from their Equity Sentences, (which have been very many) was an Argument againſt the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of their Lords, and for the receiving of this Appeal here: That this thing hath been acknowledged, even by the Rebels there; for in Sir <hi>John Temple</hi>'s Hiſtory of the firſt Progreſs of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Rebellion, written 1641. pag. 141. amongſt the ſeveral propoſitions made by the <hi>Iriſh</hi> (then in a general Rebellion) theſe two are mentioned.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That by ſeveral Acts of Parliament to be reſpectively paſſed in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> it ſhould be declared, that the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Ireland</hi> had no ſubordination to the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> but ſhould have ſupreme Juriſdiction in that Kingdom, as Abſolute as the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> here hath.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That the Act of 10 <hi>Hen.</hi> 7. called <hi>Poyning</hi>'s Act, and all other Acts expounding or explaining that Law, ſhould be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed; both which with their other dangerous propoſitions were juſtly rejected: however, it ſhews their Opinion, that at that time the Law was, or was taken and deemed to be againſt them
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:50172:48"/>in this point: and there is as much reaſon for keeping the final Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicature here, as there is for maintaining the Superiority and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligatory Power over them in the legiſlature.</p>
            <p>'Twas farther urged, That the with holding the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Lords from having the like Juriſdiction in their Parliament as the Lords in <hi>England</hi> have, in Judging upon Appeals and Writs of Error, was abſolutely neceſſary for the preſerving of the Poſſeſſions of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in <hi>Ireland;</hi> for thoſe of that Country muſt be ſuppos'd to incline to their own intereſt, and cannot be ſuppos'd ſo much inclined to love and affect the <hi>Engliſh</hi> amongſt them: And that this Power of Judging here is Co-eval with the very Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the Government.</p>
            <p>'Twas further urged, That their Precedents returned, did or concern the point in Queſtion, except the two or three Caſes in 1661, and 1662. and two Appeals lately in 1695. that their Caſe of the Prior of <hi>Lauthony</hi> in 8 <hi>Hen.</hi> 6. <hi>Prynnes</hi> Animadverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, 313, 314 was againſt them; the Prior having removed a Judgment in the <hi>King</hi>'s-<hi>Bench</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> into the Parliament there, which affirmed it, did bring a Writ of Error in the <hi>King</hi>'s-<hi>Bench</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> and they refuſed to meddle with it; the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon was, becauſe the Writ of Error before the Lords there did not lie, and that it ought to have come hither immediately; and all the reſt of their Quotations in their Printed Caſe either prove nothing at all, or too much; for they are againſt the allowance of Writs of Error in the <hi>King</hi>'s-<hi>Bench</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> and againſt the Legiſlature of <hi>England</hi>'s being able to oblige the people of <hi>Ireland,</hi> both which have been approved by conſtant practice, and therefore it was prayed, that the Appeal here might be allowed, and the Order of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Lords might be vacated.</p>
            <p>On the other ſide, it was argued, from 1 <hi>Inſt.</hi> 141. <hi>Prynne's</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimadverſions, 286. and 4 <hi>Inſt.</hi> 12. that their Parliaments had the ſame Authority there in reſpect of making Laws for that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try as the Parliaments have for <hi>England;</hi> that they have ever ſince, 10 <hi>Hen.</hi> 7. Re-enacted there ſuch ſubſequent Acts of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> as they thought good for them; and that they had the like Power of Appeals, Writs of Error and Impeachments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and, that the Cognizance of ſuch Appeals in <hi>England</hi> would produce great inconveniencies, by making poor people to attend here; whereas, they might with leſs trouble and expence have Juſtice at home; that this did agree with the reaſons of that Ancient Statute, 4 <hi>Inſt.</hi> 356. that perſons having Eſtates in <hi>Ireland,</hi> ſhould Reſide in that Kingdom, elſe half of their Eſtates ſhould go to maintain the Forts there: That this practice of receiving Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals here would be vexatious to the people of that place; and that no Court could have Juriſdiction but by grant or preſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that there could be no pretence for either in this place.</p>

            </head>
            <p>APpeal from a Decree in Chancery, the Caſe was thus; Sir <hi>Henry Wood,</hi> the Appellant's Unkle, makes a Settlement, in Conſideration of a Marriage to be had between his Daughter <hi>Mary</hi> and the Duke, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to the uſes following, <hi>i.e.</hi> in Truſt, to Receive and Pay out of the Profits 450 <hi>l.</hi> a Year, to the Lady <hi>Cheſter,</hi> for the Education and Maintenance of his Daughter, till twelve
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:50172:49"/>years of Age, then 550 <hi>l.</hi> a year till Marriage, or Seventeen years of Age, which ſhould firſt happen: and in Truſt to pay the Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due of the Profits to the Duke after Marriage, he firſt giving Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity to the ſaid Truſtees to provide Portions and Maintenance for the Daughters of the Marriage equal to the Sum he ſhould receive; and in caſe there ſhould be none, then the ſame Money to remain to the Reſpondent, and if the ſaid <hi>Mary</hi> ſhould die before Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, or Age of Seventeen years, to ſuch Uſes as Sir <hi>H. W.</hi> ſhould appoint. And if <hi>Mary,</hi> after Sir <hi>Henry</hi>'s death, die under Sixteen, the Reſpondent then unmarried to any other Woman, or after and before Seventeen, the Reſpondent then living and unmarried; or if before Seventeen ſhe ſhould marry any other, or if ſhe ſhould refuſe the Reſpondent, then 20000 <hi>l.</hi> out of the Profits to the Duke.</p>
            <p>But if the ſaid Marriage ſhall take effect after <hi>Mary</hi>'s Age of Sixteen years, and ſhe ſhall have Iſſue Male by the Reſpondent, then for the better Settlement of the Premiſſes upon the Iſſue Male, and a more ample Proviſion and Maintenance for the Reſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and his Wife, and the longeſt Liver of them, in Truſt for the ſaid Duke and <hi>Mary,</hi> for and during their Lives, and the Life of the longer liver of them; and after their Deaths, to the firſt Son, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in Tail Male; and for default of Iſſue Male to the Daughters. And for default of ſuch Iſſue in Truſt, for ſuch Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons only as Sir <hi>Henry</hi> ſhould appoint, and in default thereof to the right Heirs of Sir <hi>Henry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Henry W.</hi> at the ſame time, makes his Will, tho' dated after the Settlement, reciting that he had ſettled the Premiſſes upon the Duke and <hi>Mary</hi> for their Lives, and the Life of the Longer liver of them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and confirms it; and in Caſe the ſaid Martiage ſhould not take effect, according to the Limitations of the Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; or if the ſaid Reſpondent ſhould die without Iſſue by <hi>Mary;</hi> or if he have Iſſue by her, and that Iſſue die without Iſſue, then the Remainder to <hi>Mary</hi> for Life, and afterwards to her firſt Son; and after ſeveral mediate Remainders, then to the Appellant for Life, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and after to <hi>Thomas Webb,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Henry Wood</hi> dies, the Marriage between <hi>Mary</hi> and the Duke afterwards takes effect upon her arrival to years of Conſent: and they lived in that ſtate, till ſhe was near Seventeen years of Age, and then ſhe dies without Iſſue.</p>
            <p>The Court of <hi>Chancery</hi> decreed the Profits of the Eſtate to the Duke for Life.</p>
            <p>It was argued for the Appellant, That here was a precedent Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulative Condition; that if the Marriage take effect after Sixteen, and there be Iſſue, then to the Duke; and neither of theſe being in the Caſe, the Decree is not conſiſtent with the poſitive words of the Settlement, for that the Duke was to have it upon no other terms: That by this Settlement the Duke was thus provided for:</p>
            <p n="1">1. If the Marriage did not take effect, by <hi>Mary</hi>'s refuſal or ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king another Husband, the Duke was to have 20000 <hi>l.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="85" facs="tcp:50172:49"/>
            <p n="2">2. If the Marriage did take effect, and Iſſue was had, then the Duke was to have an Eſtate for Life, but not otherwiſe; that the words are plain and certain, that there muſt not only be a Marriage, but Iſſue Male between them; that tho' it ſhould be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed to be a good Marriage within the intention of the Settlement, ſhe living till after Sixteen years of Age, yet when a Condition Copulative, conſiſting of ſeveral Branches (as this doth) is made precedent to any Uſe or Truſt, the entire Condition muſt be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, or elſe the Uſe or Truſt can never riſe or take place: And it is not enough that one part only be performed.</p>
            <p>As to the Objection from the intention of the Parties, 'twas Anſwered, That no ſuch Intention did appear, or reaſonably could be collected from any thing in this Deed or Will: and it would be too great a violence to the words, to break that Condition in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to two, which is but one, according to the plain and natural Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>texture and Senſe of it.</p>
            <p>It hath been ſaid, That if the Duke cannot take an Eſtate for Life in the Truſt, unleſs he had Iſſue Male by the Dutcheſs, then ſhe her ſelf could not take for Life by that Truſt, unleſs there were Iſſue Male, for that their Eſtates are limited together; and then the Conſequence would be, That if there were Daughters and no Sons, the Daughters would have the Truſt of the Eſtate in their Mother's Life time, and their Mother nothing, which could not be the intent of Sir <hi>Henry Wood.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this it was anſwered, That the ſame ariſes from a plain Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake, and a Suppoſition that the Daughters (if any) ſhould take, tho' there never were a Son; whereas the Limitation to the Daughters is under the ſame precedent Condition, as the Limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Duke and Dutcheſs is: For the precedent Copulative Condition uſhers in the whole Limitation of the Truſt, ſo that the Truſt to the Daughters could no more ariſe, without Iſſue Male born, than the Truſt to the Duke and Dutcheſs.</p>
            <p>And whereas 'tis pretended, That at this rate the Duke and Dutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſs were to have had no Subſiſtence, till the Birth of Iſſue Male, which might be many years: it was anſwered, That this was a plain miſtake of the Law; for this Truſt being by the Deed and Will thus limited upon this precedent Condition of having Iſſue Male, they whoſe Eſtates in this Truſt are thus limited upon this Condition, can take nothing till the Condition be performed by Marriage and Iſſue Male; and then by the Rules of Law, till ſome of thoſe Perſons to whom the Truſt was limited, could take, the Truſt of the Eſtate deſcends to the Heir at Law, and ſhe was intituled to the Profits, till the precedent Condition ſhould be performed, or become impoſſible; and if the Condition had been performed, the Truſts would have taken effect; and being not performed, but becoming impoſſible by the Dutcheſſes death be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhe had Iſſue, the ſubſequent Truſts take effect upon her
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:50172:50"/>death. Beſides that, it is purſuant to the Rules of the Common Law, which gives to the Husband no Eſtate for Life in the Wives Inheritance, unleſs he have Iſſue by her born alive; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was prayed that the Decree might be reverſed.</p>
            <p>Then it was argued on the behalf of the Reſpondent, That Sir <hi>Henry Wood</hi> by the ſame Settlement directs, that if the Duke died before his Marriage with her, then the Truſtees ſhould diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of the Profits of the Premiſſes to the Lord <hi>George Palmer,</hi> the Duke's Brother (in caſe the Brother married her) and to the ſaid <hi>Mary</hi> for their Lives, and the Life of the longer Liver of them: And from and after the deceaſe of the Survivor of them, then to their Iſſue in Tail Male, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> without adding any words of a preceding Condition; and yet ſays, <hi>In like manner, and for the like Eſtates, as he had appointed for his ſaid Daughter and the Duke, in caſe of their Marriage;</hi> which plainly evidences his inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be, That the ſaid Duke and the Lady <hi>Mary</hi> ſhould have the Profits during their Lives, altho' they ſhould never have Iſſue Male, as the Brother would have had in caſe he had married her.</p>
            <p>Then 'twas urged, That Sir <hi>Henry Wood</hi>'s appointing the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plus of the Profits, over and above her ſaid Maintenance, for the benefit of the Duke, until his marriage, ſhows the intent, for that it can't be imag ined that he ſhould be provided for before his Marriage, and left deſtitute of all Support after it, unleſs he had Iſſue Male by her. Nay, his intention of Kindneſs to the Duke was proved further, by giving him 20000 <hi>l.</hi> in caſe ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to marry him, or died before her Marriage.</p>
            <p>And as to the Pretence of its being a Condition precedent; it was anſwered, That unleſs that Paragraph be made to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fere with it ſelf, the Duke will be intitled to an Eſtate for Life, if there were no other Clauſe in the Deed.</p>
            <p>For firſt, It's ſaid, <hi>That for a more full and ample proviſion for the ſaid Duke and his Wife, the Truſtees,</hi> &amp;c. Which words (according to the Conſtruction of the Appellant's Counſel) muſt be uſeleſs and void, unleſs the Duke were not after Marriage to have as great, if not greater Supply, then he had before the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.</p>
            <p>Then 'tis ſaid, <hi>That they ſhould be ſeized in Trust for the Duke and his Wife, and the Survivor of them, for and during their natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Lives, and the Life of the longer Liver of them.</hi> And from thence 'twas argued, That the meaning and import of the words <hi>(far and during)</hi> can be nothing leſs than the whole Duration and Continuance of their Lives, from and after Sir <hi>Henry</hi>'s Death and their Marriage.</p>
            <p>Then the Will of Sir <hi>Henry</hi> proves the Intention, for that it recites, That he had ſettled from and after his Deceaſe, the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſes in Truſt for the Duke and the ſaid <hi>Mary</hi> during their Lives, and the Life of the longer Liver of them, and takes no notice of the pretended precedent Condition; which ſhows that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:50172:50"/>them the Profits immediately after his Deceaſe and the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.</p>
            <p>Then in the Limitations over, they are not to take any benefit of or by the Premiſſes, until the death of the Duke and his Wife without Iſſue; therefore it muſt be underſtood, that the Profits in the mean time ſhould remain to the Duke and his Wife, or the Survivor of them. And then it was further obſerved, That the Duke comes in as a Purchaſer upon as valuable a Conſideration as any in the Law, <hi>viz.</hi> Marriage; and the Limitation over to the Reſpondent is avoluntary Settlement.</p>
            <p>And as to the Objection of the Marriage being before Sixteen, it was not much inſiſted on the other ſide, and in reaſon cannot be; becauſe her continuing married till after Sixteen, doth fully ſatisfie the intent of the Deed, in reference to this Matter. And many other Reaſons were urged from the Intent of the Parties, and the Nature of the Intereſt, the ſame being a Truſt Eſtate, and proper for Equity to conſtrue. And upon the whole it was pray'd that the Decree might be affirmed, but the ſame was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed.</p>

               <hi>Sir</hi> Caeſar Wood <hi>alias</hi> Cranmer, <hi>Verſus</hi> Thomas Webb.</head>
            <p>APpeal from a Decree in <hi>Chancery:</hi> The Caſe was founded upon the next preceding; The Reſpondent was one of the Coheirs of Sir <hi>Henry Wood,</hi> and claimed a Moiety of the Profits of the Premiſſes during the Duke's Life, and the ſame was decreed accordingly: And now it was argued on the behalf of the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellant, That in this Deed there was no Appointment to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondent, till after the death of the Appellant and his Iſſue; that all the pretence for <hi>Webb</hi>'s Claim was, That the Truſt to the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellant, was not to take effect till the Duke's death, altho' the ſaid Duke had no Intereſt in the Eſtate, as hath been adjudged by the Supreme Judicature of the Realm, that by the whole purport and deſign of the Settlement and Will, and the poſitive words of it, Sir <hi>Henry Wood</hi> intended the ſaid Truſts in Succeſſion and Order, as they are mentioned; that the Deſign of the whole, was not to give any thing to the Reſpondent, till after all the mediate Limitations were ſpent.</p>
            <p>It was argued on the other ſide with the Decree, That this Right of the Reſpondent to a Moiety as long as the Duke lives, is a neceſſary Conſequence of the Lord's Judgment in the other Caſe; that the ſame is founded upon fixed and eſtabliſhed Rules of Law; as that an Heir is not to be diſinherited by Conſtruction or Impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:50172:51"/>but by plain and expreſs words; nor will the Law give away an Eſtate, or make it to Commence ſooner than the plain and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs words will warrant; that wherever an Eſtate is limited in Remainder, that depends upon a Contingency or a Condition pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent, there, till the Condition be performed or Contingency happens, that Eſtate cannot Commence; that this was the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Argument for the Appeliant, in the other Caſe: And the ſame Rules hold here, for here is a precedent Condition; for after the Marriage once had, the Duke muſt die, and die without Iſſue, or that Iſſue die without Iſſue, before the Appellant can take.</p>
            <p>The Owner ſays that the Appellant is not to have it till then; that there is not one Reaſon which can be urged againſt the Duke, but may with equal force be urged againſt the Appellant in this Caſe; that the Reſpondent claims not by the Settlement, but as a Coheir, to have that which is not diſpoſed of; and what is not ſo diſpoſed, muſt deſcend or reſult for the benefit of the Heirs. Wherefore it was prayed that the Decree ſhould be affirmed; and it was affirmed.</p>

               <p>It was argued on behalf of the Plaintiffs, in the Writ of Error, that this Judgment and the affirmance of it were Erroneous.</p>

               <p>'Twas inſiſted on below, That a Parſon once Ordained, is certainly preſumed to have ſufficient Learning for any Cure of Souls; nay, that ſuch Examination upon his Ordination, ſhall conclude any ſucceeding or other Ordinary from Examining ſuch a Perſon when Preſented to a Benefice, but this is contrary both to Reaſon and Law, and ſo agreed by moſt of the Judges, who delivered their Opinions for the Plaintiff in the Action below.</p>
               <p>'Tis againſt all Reaſon and Senſe, That becauſe one Ordinary thought him able to take Orders and Preach in his Dioceſs, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, another muſt deem him able and ſufficiently Learned (tho' he knows the contrary) to accept a Benefice in his Dioceſs; 'tis Abſurd, that upon a Preſentation, he is to be Examined, but not refuſed, tho' found <hi>inhabilis,</hi> and this becauſe he was in Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and he could not be Preſented unleſs in Orders, and yet tho' in Orders, if he be Preſented, he muſt be Examined, but to what purpoſe, paſſeth all underſtanding, if his Prieſthood or Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders preſumes him to be qualified! 'Tis likewiſe to ſuppoſe Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and Ability to be an inſeparable quality; That an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Scholar can never become leſs ſo. By the Old Law, the Biſhop had two Months time to Examine, 2 <hi>Roll's Abr.</hi> 354. by <hi>Hob.</hi> 317. He hath a convenient time, and by <hi>Can.</hi> 1 <hi>Jac.</hi> 1 <hi>cap.</hi> 95. the two Months is reduced to 28 Days: And the Ordinary both in Conſcience and by the Obligations which his very Order doth import, is obliged to Judge for himſelf as well as to Examine; the contrary is repugnant to his Office of a Judge, to be forced or compelled to inſtitute every Preſentee, fit or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit: Beſides the Ordinary <hi>pro Tempore</hi> hath the particular care of all the Dioceſs, and during a vacancy, is to take care of ſupply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every particular Cure within his Diſtrict; then when he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits and inſtitutes, the very form of Words, is, <hi>Accipe curam me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am &amp; tuam,</hi> which renders it more Abſurd, that <hi>nolens volens,</hi> he muſt transfer his Cure to a Man not able in his Judgment to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute it.</p>
               <p>'Tis againſt the Rule of Law, for that the Words of it are expreſs, <hi>articuli Cleri, cap.</hi> 13. and this <hi>Cooke</hi> declares to be Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmative of the Common-Law; <hi>Item petitur quod perſonae Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſt' quas Dominus Rex ad beneficia preſentet Eccleſiaſtica ſi Epiſcopus eas non Admittat ut puta propter defectum Scientiae, vel aliam cauſam rationabilem, non Subeant examinationem Laicar' perſonar' in caſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus antedictis prout his temporibus attentetur de facto, contra Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas ſanctiones, ſed adeant Judicem Eccleſiaſticum ad quem de jure pertinet pro Remedio prout justum fuerit conſequendo reſpons' de Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nietate perſone preſentate ad beneficium Eccleſiaſticum pertinet Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natio ad Judicem Eccleſiasticum &amp; ita est hactenus uſitatum &amp; fiat in futurum.</hi>

               <p>Then my Lord <hi>Coke</hi> in his Comment upon that Statute in 2 <hi>Inſt.</hi> 631, 632. ſaith, that there may be diverſe Exceptions to Perſons preſented as Baſtardy, Villenage, Outlawry, Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, Laity, Under age, or Criminal and Lewd in his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, or inability to diſcharge his Paſtoral duty, as if he be Unlearned; and the Examination of the Ability and Sufficiency of the Perſon preſented, belongs to the Biſhop, who is the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Judge, and not a Miniſter, and may and ought to refuſe the Perſon preſented; if he be not <hi>Idonea perſona:</hi> And if the cauſe of refuſal, be default of Learning, Hereſie or the like, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the knowledge of the Eccleſiaſtical Law; then he muſt give notice to the Patron, ſo that default of Learning, is by him (who was no great friend to the Juriſdiction of Court Chriſtian) agreed to be Subject to the Eccleſiaſtical inquiry, and then in Pleading, he muſt ſhow the cauſe of refuſal, and the Party may deny the ſame, and then the Court ſhall write to the Metropoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, or to the Guardian of the Spiritualities, <hi>ſede vacante,</hi> to certifie if the cauſe be thus, and his Certificate is concluſive; if the Preſentee be Dead, it ſhall be tried by a Jury, 15 <hi>Hen.</hi> 7.7. the Biſhop is declared to be a Judge, and not a Miniſter in this caſe of Examining a Man's Ability; he is a Judge in this caſe as he is in caſe of a Reſignation; for an Ordinary may refuſe it, and without his acceptance, 'tis no Reſignation, and muſt be ſo Pleaded, <hi>Noy.</hi> 147. <hi>Bro. tit Bar.</hi> 81. <hi>&amp;</hi> 2. <hi>Cro.</hi> 197. and ſo agreed, even in the Caſe of <hi>Leach</hi> and <hi>Thompſon,</hi> in <hi>Reg.</hi> 53. is a Conſultation upon this very ſurmiſe that inability, <hi>ad Retinend' beneficium propter Crimina,</hi> belongs to Court Chriſtian, and that the Ordinary is Judge thereof, which is much ſtronger than our caſe, becauſe there was a Freehold veſted by induction. But this hath been agreed by that Court from whoſe Judgment the preſent Appeal is, that a refuſal may be upon inſufficiency, appearing upon an Examination, upon a new Preſentation; and conſtant practiſe proves it.</p>
               <p>The greater if any doubt is upon the Plea, if good, it ſays, that he was Examined, and upon Examination, was found incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
               <p>The Exception taken to it, is, that it doth not ſet forth the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular parts of Learning, in which he is deficient, that the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Court may Judge, if it were a ſufficient cauſe of refuſal, which is to change and turn it, <hi>ad aliud examen,</hi> that Learning is requiſite for a Preſentee to be Benefic'd; they would not have the Ordinary to determine what Qualifications a perſon ought to have in order to take a Benefice, but the Judges in <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall:</hi> They can have no colour for this pretence, but that the Ordinary may have refuſed, when competently Learned in their Opinions, and they cannot ſay that the Law hath ſettled any Rules or mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of Learning requiſite. Some ſay, Latin is not requiſite ſince the Liturgy is now in Engliſh, and therefore they would Judge of it; others ſay, the leſs Learning the better Preacher, if can Read, and Pray, and Preach, and be indued with Spiritual Gifts,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:50172:53"/>and ſo is their Replication; others ſay, that the Ordinary's Judgment muſt be ſubmitted to the Judge's Opinion of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of Knowledge neceſſary; then they have a Popular pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, that this will give the Biſhops too great a Power of refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal, and ſo reſtrain Patrons from their privilege of Preſenting, and thereby make themſelves Collators: But, there's no danger of that, becauſe there muſt be notice and a convenient time for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Preſentation, and the danger of this reſtraint, is as much the other way, for then the Temporal Courts are to do it, and its much at one to the Patron, which is to declare the inability, the Ordinary or the Temporal Courts: On both ſides, it muſt be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed, that default of <hi>Literature,</hi> is a good and juſt cauſe of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſal, the Queſtion is, who ſhall judge of it; it is ſaid, <hi>minus Sufficiens in Literatura &amp; ca ratione inhabilis,</hi> i.e. (it being inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite) <hi>in omni Literatura neceſſaria.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But, they Cavil at the Word <hi>minus ſufficiens,</hi> as if that agreed him ſomewhat Learned, and forget that 'tis ſaid, <hi>ac perinde inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pax:</hi> And, <hi>minus ſufficiens</hi> is in Lawyer's Latin, totally inſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and ſo 'tis uſed in all Demurrers to Declarations, Pleas, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications, <hi>quod Narr' vel placit' pred' &amp; Materia in eodem content' minus ſufficient' in Lege exiſtunt ad quam vel quod,</hi> the party, <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe non habet nec per Legem terrae Tenetur aliquo modo reſpondere;</hi> i. e. 'tis good for nothing, 'tis inſufficient; the Court in their Judgments upon the inſufficiency of the Plea, do always ſay, <hi>quia minus ſufficien' exiſtit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then it was argued, That it is a good Plea to all intents and purpoſes, from the nature of the thing, and the impoſſibility of making it more particular and certain. 2. From the ſufficiency of it to all intents and purpoſes of Tryal. 3. From the Precedents and thoſe of Antiquity which warrant this form of pleading. 4. From the miſchiefs and inconveniencies which muſt follow and enſue, if a greater particularity were required.</p>
               <p n="1">1. From the nature of the thing, and the impoſſibility of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it more particular and certain; if the Biſhop were bound to ſet down in particular, and at large, every point of Learning wherein this poor wretch was and is deficient, 'twould be a Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding like to a juſtification of an Action done by a private Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and not like to the Pleading of the Act of a Judge, which this is; 'twould be ſo large as to render it impoſſible for to joyn an Iſſue thereupon; and then they would have demurred with a Cauſe, becauſe <hi>multiplex duplex incertum &amp; perplex',</hi> and the reſt of our uſual <hi>Adjectives</hi> upon thoſe occaſions; the Aſſignment of ſeveral and many particulars would have been double, and good cauſe of Exception, becauſe one particular might be found true and another not, and the Aſſignment of one particular would have been adjudged inſufficient, for then they would have ſaid that Learning is of a Complex nature, and if a Man ſhould fail in anſwering any one particular, tho' common Queſtion, yet he might be qualified in general: And therefore the Aſſignment of
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:50172:53"/>one defect, tho' never ſo groſs, ſhall not make a Clerk, <hi>minime capax,</hi> and therefore no good Plea: For, if a particular be Aſſigned, that would not prove a general Defect of knowledge, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the words of the Law; which is the only thing that could make him incapable, <hi>ad habend' beneficium cum Curia Animar'</hi> and therefore the Biſhop as a Judge, returns him <hi>in literatura inſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiens &amp; ea de cauſa minime capax,</hi> and the ſpecial inſtances would have been Evidences upon a new Tryal, or Examination before the Arch-Biſhop.</p>
               <p>Now this cauſe of refuſal, diſtinguiſhes the caſe from all others, that they can inſiſt upon; all other inabilities of a Clerk depend upon one ſingle point, as Baſtardy, Villenage, Outlawry, Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, Lay-man, Under-age, or Eccleſiaſtical Infancy: So all Crimes muſt have their foundation from a particular Act, as Adultery, Perjury, Simony, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In theſe it ſhall not be enough to Plead that he was <hi>inhabilis</hi> generally, or <hi>criminoſus,</hi> generally <hi>&amp; ideo inhabilis,</hi> becauſe no body can be <hi>criminoſus,</hi> but he that hath done ſome particular Crime, and that is to have a ſeveral Tryal according to its reſpective nature; if it be an Eccleſiaſtical Offence, then there is a particular method of Tryal; if a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral, then another, and ſo ſays <hi>Coke,</hi> 2 <hi>Inſt.</hi> 632. and therefore a particularity is required there, but here 'tis all tryable by the ſame way, <hi>viz.</hi> a new Examination before the Arch-Biſhop: Here the matter it ſelf admits of no greater certainty; for that 'tis a general deficiency of Learning only, which can make an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capacity of diſcharging the Paſtoral Office; it is a matter that muſt appear by a variety of Queſtions, and cannot be proved by any one ſingle inſtance whatſoever.</p>
               <p>This is the true reaſon and difference why in ſeveral Caſes gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Pleading hath been denied, and why in this Caſe it hath been always uſed, and never excepted againſt.</p>
               <p>Then it was argued, That this Plea was ſufficient to all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents and purpoſes of Tryal and Determination.</p>
               <p>By our Law that Plea is ſufficiently certain, which may be Tryed without inveigling either Court or Jury, that is, it muſt be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible and plain; and this ſurely is plain enough, the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary had a Power to refuſe him, for want of Learning, ſufficient to enable him to diſcharge his Paſtoral Office; he Pleads that he was <hi>Minus ſufficien' in Literatura;</hi> this is to be tried by the Certificate of the Arch-Biſhop, or the Guardian of the Spirituali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, during a vacancy and that is evident, by 39 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3.1, 2. 40 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3.25. and from <hi>Speccot</hi>'s Caſe, 5 <hi>Rep.</hi> 7.</p>
               <p>There never was an Objection made to the uncertainty of any Plea, if the Matter could be fairly reduced to an Iſſue for a Trial; now here the Court might certainly have written to the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop to have known <hi>utrum</hi> this Creature, were <hi>minus ſufficiens in Literatura &amp; ea Ratione inhabilis,</hi> and the <hi>actus Curiae</hi> of the Biſhop would have been Evidence before his Grace, and he might have
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:50172:54"/>certified that he was, or that he was not ſufficiently Learned: No, ſay they, the Court muſt not write to the Archbiſhop to know that, till it be ſaid in what Points of Learning he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective; and if theſe ſhall be thought material Parts of Learning for a Rector, then they muſt write to know if <hi>Hodder</hi> had them or not; but if they think them not material for the Qualifications of a Paſtor, they muſt not write at all: This is the true Engliſh of the Argument. But it was argued, That the Temporal Court is only to judge, that the Cauſe of Refuſal, if true, was a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Cauſe; and the Books are, that a general default of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is a good Cauſe; and this the Archbiſhop is to try: And this is certain enough for to make an Iſſue or Queſtion proper for that Trial.</p>
               <p>Beſides, A greater Latitude and Generality hath of late been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed in pleading of Proceedings in Courts, and before Judges, then formerly. In ancient days, if a Man pleaded a Judgment in a Court in <hi>Weſtminſter-hall,</hi> they ſet forth the whole; then they came to allow of a <hi>taliter fuit proceſſum,</hi> and an Abridgment of the Proceedings; then came a <hi>Recuperavit</hi> only: And this was becauſe that all Proceedings in the Superiour Courts were to be preſumed regular, till the contrary were ſhewn: But this was denied a long while to Inferiour Courts, becauſe theſe were tied to ſtricter forms, and therefore were ſtill forced to ſet forth the whole; then they allowed a <hi>taliter fuit proceſſum</hi> for them, provided ſtill they were Courts of Record: But now they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it in pleading of a Juſtification upon a Recovery in an Hundred Court, becauſe the whole muſt be given in Evidence; ſo that ſuch a formal Nicety in Pleading is not generally requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red now as was formerly. Beſides, In Matters triable by the Spiritual Law, there is always leſs particularity required in Plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, then in others triable in Courts Temporal, as in Baſtardy, Divorce, Depoſition, Literature, Profeſſion, and the like: It's enough if ſo much be alledged, that they may write to know whether the Fact be ſo or no; and upon a Return thereof that 'tis ſo, they can give Judgment. Now if his Grace my Lord Archbiſhop, in this Caſe, upon Examination had returned that this Preſentee was <hi>in Literatura minus ſufficiens,</hi> as undoubtedly he would, (and ſo the Plaintiff thought, otherwiſe he would have joyned Iſſue) and ſo <hi>ea occaſione inhabilis,</hi> then unqueſtionably Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment muſt have been for the Plaintiff in Error; for default of Learning is a good cauſe of Refuſal, and muſt be agreed to be ſo. The Rule laid down by my Lord <hi>Anderſon,</hi> 3 <hi>Leon.</hi> 200. is, That in Matters triable by our Law, all things iſſuable ought to be ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially alledged, in order to have a convenient Trial; but in Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Spiritual the Law is otherwiſe, becauſe there's no peril in the Trial; and therefore if certain enough to ground a Certificate it's ſufficient.</p>
               <pb n="95" facs="tcp:50172:54"/>
               <p>My Lord <hi>Hob.</hi> 296. in <hi>Slade</hi> and <hi>Drake</hi>'s Caſe, ſaith, That in pleading a Divorce, you muſt ſhew before whom it was, 11 <hi>Hen.</hi> 7.27. but you need not ſhew all the Proceedings as you ſhould of a Recovery at Common Law; and the Reaſon why you muſt ſhew before whom, is only that it may be known, who is to try and certifie it. In <hi>Burdell</hi>'s Caſe 18 <hi>Edw.</hi> 4.29, 30. 'tis clear that in all Spiritual Acts triable by the Spiritual Law, it is neceſſary to plead no more than what may give the Court ground to write to the proper Eccleſiaſtical Officer, and to judge by his Certificate. Now here is ground enough in this Caſe for the Archbiſhop to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine this ignorant Perſon, for ſo he muſt be taken to be; for ſo he is found by one Ordinary, and he refuſes to be examined by the Archbiſhop: he is pleaded not to have Learning enough to capacitate him for a Cure of Souls, and that by one whom the Law hath conſtituted his Judge: 'Tis true, this is traverſable and triable by the Archbiſhop, but all thoſe Inſtances of his Inſufficiency that were taken in the Biſhops Court, would be Evidences of the ſame before the Archbiſhop, proceeding in an Eccleſiaſtical manner, tho' not ſo proper, tho' not poſſible to be ſet forth in the Temporal Court; this is not a General Return of a Perſon <hi>inhabilis,</hi> which might occaſion an Enquiry into all ſort of Diſabilities; but a Special Plea of <hi>inhabilis, quia inſufficienter Literatus;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no further Enquiry is neceſſary, then into the Learning of the Party, as Capacitates him for a Rector.</p>
               <p>It was in the third place argued from the Preſidents of Plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in this Caſe, and other Caſes of Pleading upon like Occaſions, and thoſe both Ancient and Modern.</p>
               <p>40 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3.25. In a <hi>Quare Impedit</hi> (as this is) the Biſhop pleads as here, That he Examined the Clerk preſented, and found upon Examination <hi>que il ne fuit ſufficiens</hi> Letter'd, and thereupon alledges Notice to the Patron, <hi>&amp; per lapſum temporis,</hi> he juſtifies his own Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation: Upon this, there's no diſpute but that thus far it was well pleaded; but the only doubt was, whether the words, <hi>and ſo diſabled,</hi> ſhould be added to the Iſſue? and they were ordered to be part of the Iſſue in that Caſe, and ſo they ought to be in this Caſe, and ſo they are <hi>&amp; ea ratione inhabilis;</hi> this Caſe is exactly parallel to that in queſtion; and upon this Plea there was Iſſue joyned, and the Trial was directed to be by the Guardian of the Spiritualities, <hi>va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cante Sede Cantuarienſi,</hi> nothing can be offered againſt this, only that 'tis Ancient, and the Law is changed, but by what Authority is hard to know; there is no Act of the Legiſlature to alter it: much hath been done to help againſt Niceties in Pleading; nothing to require more. And <hi>Bro. Quare Impedit</hi> 168. they were compelled to joyn Iſſue, able or not able, in that reſpect.</p>
               <p>39 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3.1 <hi>&amp;</hi> 2. The Earl of <hi>Arundel verſus</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Cheſter,</hi> ſays the Book, tho' it appears plainly to be a miſ-print, from the name of the Church, and the Trial <hi>per pais,</hi> and the Antiquity of the Biſhoprick it ſelf, it muſt be the ſame, that in the <hi>Abridgments</hi> is
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:50172:55"/>called the Earl of <hi>Arundel verſus</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Exeter,</hi> the Biſhop pleads as here, That he examined the Clerk preſented, and found him <hi>perſona inhabilis,</hi> to have a Benefice in the Church; and Iſſue is joyned upon that which is ſtronger then ours, and a Trial by Jury is directed out of the County of <hi>Cornwall,</hi> becauſe the Clerk was dead. Here are two Caſes in which all the different Trials are taken that can be had by the Guardian where the Preſentee was living, and by Jury when dead, becauſe he could not be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined: And in both theſe Caſes Iſſue is taken upon this Plea, and that in great Caſes, and after long Debate. And, according to the Lord <hi>Coke,</hi> in this Reign the Law was pure and uncorrupt, and flouriſhed.</p>
               <p>Then were urged Modern Precedents, <hi>Mich.</hi> 15 <hi>&amp;</hi> 16 <hi>Eliz.

               </p>
               <p>Another Precedent there is <hi>Hill.</hi> 6 <hi>Eliz.

'Tis no Anſwer, that here was no Solemn Judgment upon this very Point, for it doth rather inforce the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Precedents; it argues that the Law was taken to be ſo clear for the validity of this Plea, that no Lawyer would ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture upon a Demurrer, but rather would truſt to a Jury upon the Evidence of notice, it argues it ſo conſtant a Courſe and Method of Pleading in theſe Caſes, that none was ſo hardy as to diſpute it.</p>
               <p>38 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3.2. <hi>Perjurius</hi> was alledged by the Biſhop in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentee, and held to be well enough, but nothing of manner, time and place, nor any Conviction of it mentioned, and yet this was admitted a good Plea, 2 <hi>Rolls Abridg.

Quare Impedit</hi> 170. <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice Rhodes</hi> 3 <hi>Leon.</hi> 100. vouched a Caſe in 30 <hi>Edw.</hi> 1. out of a Manuſcript of the Lord <hi>Catlins,</hi> wherein upon a <hi>Quare non Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit,</hi> the Defendant pleaded that the Preſentee was <hi>Schiſmaticus &amp; Adulter,</hi> and the Court commanded that he ſhould hold to one or other of them, for which he ſaid <hi>Adulter;</hi> from hence 'tis ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, that the Court did not diſlike the Plea for the generality, but the doubleneſs.</p>
               <pb n="97" facs="tcp:50172:55"/>
               <p>And then it was ſaid, That after all theſe Preſidents on this ſide, and many others which might be Cited of the like generali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in other caſes, 'twill be difficult to ſhew one ſingle Inſtance or Caſe in which this matter of general defect of Learning was ever pleaded otherwiſe, or any one Judgment againſt any Biſhop whatever, upon ſuch a Plea; for tho' in ſome Caſes, which they ſay are parallel and ſimilar, tho' in truth they are not, as <hi>Crimino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> and <hi>Schiſmaticus</hi> hath been adjudged too general, yet this Plea of <hi>Minima in Literatura ſufficiens ac ea ratione incapax,</hi> as it has always been uſed, without alteration of words, ſo has it never yet been excepted againſt, and in theſe Preſidents of <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cited, hath been thought good, and Iſſue joyned there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon.</p>
               <p>This was the ancient form of Pleading, and (as all thoſe anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Pleas were) founded upon Reaſon, being ſuch as the Subject Matter is capable of.</p>
               <p>In the Caſe of a Coroner it's a good Cauſe to remove him, <hi>quia fuit minime idoneus ad exequendum officium iſtud,</hi> and no charge of any particular inſufficiency aſſigned, <hi>Fitzh. Nat. Brev.</hi> 163. and there is no queſtion but that 'twould be a good Cauſe, and ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently certain, in a <hi>Scire Facias</hi> to repeal, vacate, or cancel Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Patents for an Office in the Law, to ſay <hi>in Legibus hujus Regnt</hi> Angliae <hi>minus ſufficient' inſtructus,</hi> without aſſigning any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Caſe or Statute that a Man blundered at, or was ignorant in. Suppoſe an Office in the Law, to which the King or a private Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon hath the Nomination, and the Court refuſes to admit a Man ſo named, and an Action brought for that Refuſal, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> would it not be a good Plea to ſay the Party was <hi>minus ſufficiens in Scientia Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gum &amp; ea Ratione inhabilis;</hi> and particular Inſtances are Eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
               <p>This is in the Negative, like a <hi>non fuit dampnificatus,</hi> and there you never need to ſhew how; unleſs 'twere a particular Incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance at the time of the Contract; otherwiſe 'tis always a good Plea.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Non Compos</hi> 'tis never ſhewn in particular wherein, or what Feats of Frenzy; <hi>Non compos</hi> implies that he had a general De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, diſabling him at that time to do an Act obligatory and valid; and that reſembles this, for you need not ſhew wherein; but the Particulars are Evidence.</p>
               <p>The Reaſon of the thing proves the Convenience and Solidity of the diſtinction between Pleading a Negative and Affirmative: For inſtance in this Caſe, the Negative pleaded implies an entire denial of ſufficient Learning to qualifie him for a Cure of Souls, and that juſtifies the Ordinary; and our Law Books are full of this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction; Mode and other Circumſtances of Quality, Time, and Place, are requiſite in Affirmative Pleas, none of which are neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary in Negatives. There might be cited infinite numbers of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to that purpoſe, as <hi>Mauſer</hi>'s Caſe 2 <hi>Rep.</hi> 4. <hi>Broughton</hi>'s Caſe 5 <hi>Rep.</hi> 24. <hi>Aſton</hi> and <hi>Hill</hi> 3 <hi>Cro.</hi> 253. <hi>Hutchinſon verſus Lowſon,</hi> 3 <hi>Cro.</hi> 393. <hi>Wild</hi> and <hi>Dowſe, Latch.</hi> 159. And as the Foundation
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:50172:56"/>of all thoſe, is the 40 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3.30. which is the ground of all theſe, and many more ſubſequent Authorities to the like effect: But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, there's one modern Caſe, 'tis <hi>Church verſus Brunſwick, Sid.</hi> 334. Bond to pay from time to time a Moiety of all ſuch Moneys as from time to time he ſhould receive; and payment of a Moiety generally, without ſhewing the particulars in certain, was held a good Plea; and the reaſon of that Judgment maintains the Rule now contended for, which was, becauſe 'tis of what he ſhould receive from time to time; otherwiſe if thoſe words had been o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted; becauſe in that Caſe there would be a ſtuffing of the Rolls with a multiplicity of Particulars; and the ſame Reaſon holds in the Caſe at Bar.</p>
               <p>Then 'tis conſiderable, and deſerving of a Thought, That if Learning be requiſite to an Office Temporal, for a Slander in which an Action lies, there theſe very words would bear an Action. As to ſay of a Judge, or the like, the very words here mentioned, with reference to his Office, 'twould be deemed Scandalous and Actionable: Now our Law will not allow uncertain, doubtful, and ambiguous words to be ſo.</p>
               <p>Even in Affirmatives our Law allows of general Pleading, where Particulars would be many: As in Bond for performance of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants upon an Apprentices Indenture for finding him Meat, Drink, Waſhing, Lodging, and other Neceſſaries, held that <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venit</hi> Meat, Drink, Waſhing, Lodging, <hi>&amp; alias res noceſſarias,</hi> is a good Plea, tho' intirely uncertain what or how much; and the Reaſon is not only, becauſe 'tis in the words of the Covenant, for that Reaſon doth not always hold, for many times you muſt ſhew how, and are forced to vary from the words of the Covenant in the Breach; as in caſe of quiet Enjoyment, Breach muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge how and by whom, and under what Title the Man was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbed; but there's another Reaſon, becauſe the Particulars would be many.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cryps verſus</hi> Sir <hi>Henry Baynton,</hi> 3 <hi>Bulſtrode</hi> 31. Caſe <hi>ſur aſſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit,</hi> That <hi>J. S.</hi> being a Friend of the Defendants, and coming to the Plaintiffs Houſe, he fell ſick; the Defendant, in conſideration that the Plaintiff would provide for him ſuch Neceſſaries as he ſhould want, he would <hi>bene &amp; fideliter ſolvere proinde:</hi> The Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff ſhews that he lay there two Months; that the Plaintiff provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him Neceſſaries amounting in value to, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and held good without ſhewing the Particulars to avoid a multiplicity of Reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; ſo 'tis for a Surgeons or Apothecary's Cure.</p>
               <p>Another Rule in Pleading there is, That a Certainty, or a Generality in Pleading ſhall be required, according to the nature of the Subject Matter pleaded. In pleading of Breach of a Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute Law, it's enough to uſe the Negative of the words of ſuch Statute, as it is in Caſe of a Covenant; and by the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in this Caſe, where a Statute ſays the Biſhop may refuſe <hi>propter defectum Scientiae,</hi> it's enough to ſay <hi>in Literatura minus ſufficiens,</hi> eſpecially when 'tis added <hi>ac perinde inhabilis.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="99" facs="tcp:50172:56"/>
               <p>Then were urged the Miſchiefs and Inconveniences which muſt enſue and follow upon the Conſtruction which they would make, that this Plea is uncertain; for their Reaſon only can be, as was ſaid before, that the Court may judge if it be ſuch a Deficiency of Learning as diſables to hold a Curacy of Souls; and this is the Reaſon all their Caſes go upon, and the Reaſon inſiſted upon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low; <hi>i. e.</hi> in effect that they muſt try it, not the Archbiſhop. The ſame Pretence is applicable to any other defect, and 'twill in Conſequence confound Juriſdictions; 'twill make an Enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Temporal, and Diminution of the Eccleſiaſtical Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions, tho' both are founded upon the ſame <hi>Engliſh</hi> Laws, and of equal Age and Authority: Nor is it any Anſwer which they have alledged againſt this, That the Judgment at Law is not that this <hi>Hodder</hi> ſhall have Inſtitution, but that a Writ ſhall go to the Metropolitan to require him to admit a fit Perſon upon Mr. <hi>Hele</hi>'s Preſentation; and that if Mr. <hi>Hodder</hi> be preſented, the Archbiſhop may refuſe him as inſufficient; and ſo the Archbiſhop is ſtill Judge of the Sufficiency. This looks plauſible: but they omit or forget the Conſequence, that if this Judgment ſtand, then if the Archbiſhop refuſe, the Temporal Courts muſt Judge upon another Writ, Whether the Cauſe of Refuſal were in a point of Learning, which they think requiſite, for he muſt not plead a general Defect of Learning, but mention Particulars, that they may judge of them; this is to ſubject even his Grace the Metropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litan to their Opinion, in an Affair within his own Juriſdiction and Conuſance. It is at laſt to enforce the Epiſcopal Judges to contradict their own Opinions, and to admit Perſons which they think not ſufficiently Learned; tho' the firſt Judgment doth not directly place in <hi>Hodder,</hi> yet the next will, if the Archbiſhop prove of the ſame mind: Now this is apparently the Conſequence, from the pretended Reaſon of the Judgment for them; and it is in effect to deny the old Law, that a defect of Learning is a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Cauſe of Refuſal; and that the Ordinary is Judge of that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and not the Temporal Court.</p>
               <p>And then as to the Caſes objected <hi>Dyer</hi> 254. the Biſhop of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich</hi>'s Caſe in a <hi>Quare Impedit,</hi> which is likewiſe in 2 <hi>Rolls A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridg.</hi> 355, where the Biſhop pleads that the Preſentee was a common haunter of Taverns and other Places, and Games un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful, <hi>ob quod &amp; diverſa alia Crimina conſimilia praed',</hi> the Preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee <hi>fuit Criminoſus &amp; ſic inhabilis &amp; non idonea perſona,</hi> and this was held an ill Plea: But the Grounds and Reaſons of that Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment were not for the generality of the Plea, but becauſe the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects ſpecially declared before were not ſufficient to make the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentee <hi>&amp; ſic Criminoſus,</hi> as being not <hi>Mala in ſe,</hi> but <hi>prohibita</hi> by particular Laws under certain Penalties. Nay, the Argument they would make from the general word <hi>Criminoſus,</hi> will not hold in the Caſe in queſtion, but is clearly diſtinguiſhable from it; becauſe one ſingle Act, one Crime ſpecially ſet forth, would diſable the Man; but in this caſe Ignorance, that works a Diſabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, muſt not be of any one particular thing whatſoever, but a
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:50172:57"/>general defect of Knowledge. And another Reaſon againſt their Inference from theſe and the like Caſes, is this, they belong to a different Examen, and upon that they require (as was ſaid before) a different pleading.</p>
               <p>The great Caſe, and the only one that can be pretended to come near this, is <hi>Speccot</hi>'s Caſe, mentioned in every contempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary Report of that Age, as a new Caſe; and a new one it is; and the Reaſons of it are differently reported in divers Books; and in truth, the Reaſons of the Judgment do not warrant it, nor make it applicable to the Caſe at Bar.</p>
               <p>The Authority of it is queſtionable, for they agree, Schiſm or Hereſie, which the Judges there take to be all one, a Cauſe of Refuſal; and others ſaid, they did not know what was <hi>Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticus inveteratus;</hi> but they did not conſider that the Archbiſhop might, tho' they did not; but perhaps the Ordinary may judge that to be Schiſm which is not: and therefore the Temporal Courts are to judge what is Schiſm; and in the enforcing of this Caſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, they ſaid the Ordinary is Judge only of Matters of Fact, not if the Fact be Schiſm; which is ſomewhat ſtrange.</p>
               <p>The Reports of that Caſe are 5 <hi>Rep.</hi> 57. 1 <hi>Anderſon</hi> 189, 190. <hi>Gold.</hi> 36, and 52. and 3 <hi>Leon.</hi> 198, 199, and 300. in that Caſe the Biſhop pleaded that the Preſentee was <hi>Schiſmaticus inveteratus &amp; ideo non habilis:</hi> upon the validity of this Plea there were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Arguments; Two of the Judges, ſays my Lord <hi>Anderſon,</hi> were for the Plaintiff, and two for the Defendant; and for the Deciſion of the Matter, the Opinion of the other was asked, and by the greater Opinion Judgment was given <hi>pro quer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then were repeated my Lord <hi>Anderſon</hi>'s words, <hi>fol.</hi> 189. the Inſtances that were urged, were, ſays he, <hi>Criminoſus &amp; Perjurus,</hi> but they are Matters triable both by Law, Spiritual and Temporal, and the <hi>Coment,</hi> or how is neceſſary to be ſhewn to determine the Trial; but <hi>Schiſmaticus</hi> in the principal Cauſe ſhall be tried only by the Spiritual Court, and not by the Temporal, as that of an Heretick may be generally pleaded: And divers Caſes were put to prove General Pleas and Iſſues triable at Common Law, and yet ſays he Judged <hi>pro Quer'.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is my Lord <hi>Anderſon</hi>'s Opinion of that Caſe, and whether the Ancient Authorities vouched in that Caſe, do warrant that Judgment, muſt be ſubmitted.</p>
               <p>Beſides, by our Law 'tis not any one Opinion, tho' judicially delivered, that can make or alter the Law, nay, it doth not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige any further than the reaſon of it is conſiderable, and agrees with the conſtitution and the Rules of Law; my Lord <hi>Vaughan</hi> always declared in favour of Reaſon and Authority, and that in Honour of our Law, for the contrary is to ſay, 'tis founded upon no Reaſon; then 'twas urged, that this Judgment was when the Courts below were in ſtruggle with the Eccleſiaſtical, and the then High Commiſſion Courts Erected by 1 <hi>Eliz.</hi> had given ſome provocation; which, with frequent Prohibitions, gave occaſions to the Diſputes between the Biſhops and the Judges, in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:50172:57"/>of the Reign of K. <hi>Jac.</hi> 1. But admitting the Caſe to be Law, the ſame is eaſily diſtinguiſhable from this, and founded upon different Reaſons which cannot govern or influence this.</p>
               <p>'Twas urged firſt in that Caſe there was ſome poſſibility for the Biſhop to have ſet out the Hereſie certainly and particularly, for all Hereſie muſt be founded upon ſome particular Tenet, that is Repugnant to the common received and Orthodox Doctrine. Now in this Caſe, ſay they, the Hereſie ought to be Aſſigned, that the party may Traverſe it, and purge himſelf, and the Arch-Biſhop not to be inveighled and obliged to run over all the ſpecies of Hereſie, which, ſay they, may be almoſt impoſſible, but may have only one particular Opinion to Examine, whether the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentee did obſtinately maintain it, for if the Temporal Court had been of Opinion, that ſuch Tenet in particular was not He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie, tho' the Ordinary thought it ſo, yet then they would have over-ruled the Plea, and not have wrote to the Arch-Biſhop at all: This is the ſole cauſe of that Judgment, and then the conſequence will be as was obſerved before. But their own reaſon fails in this Caſe, for here the ſufficiency of Learning is Traverſable; for as hath been ſhewn it hath often been Traverſed, and as to the <hi>ea Ratione inhabilis,</hi> no Objection can be to that, for the old Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities Cited do warrant, nay, require it; and all Pleas of Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial <hi>non eſt fact'</hi> as by breaking of a Seal, and the like are in the ſame manner.</p>
               <p>Then beſides the very words of the Law of <hi>Articuli Cleri,</hi> are very much worthy of conſideration; it impowers the Biſhop to refuſe a Clerk, <hi>propter defectum ſcientiae &amp; alias Cauſas rationa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biles,</hi> now all theſe Cauſes of Refuſal, mentioned in their caſes, comes under the <hi>cauſas Rationabiles,</hi> and <hi>cauſa vaga &amp; in certa eſtnon Rationabilis,</hi> now want of Learning is not included by intendment, but by expreſs words, and therefore need not otherwiſe be ſet forth; take it for granted, that as they would have it, the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Judges are to Judge what is a reaſonable cauſe of Refuſal; yet they are not to Judge, if defect of Learning be a cauſe or not, for in that the Statute is poſitive; then if ſaid to be deficient in Learning, <hi>&amp; ea ratione inhabilis,</hi> they had nothing to Judge up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they were only to write to the Arch-Biſhop to know if the Fact were true, if he were deficient, and therefore it need not be ſet forth any otherwiſe, then as the Statute expreſſes it; tho' in that caſe, they ſay, there are divers ſorts of Schiſms and Hereſies in Doctrines on which the Biſhop might warrant his Refuſal, yet 'tis not ſo much as once pretended, there are any Opinions deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in thoſe caſes, that deficiency of Learning is ſubject to the ſame Rules of Pleading.</p>
               <p>Then the Plea is in the Negative, as was ſhewed before, which is more than enough to make a good difference; and Negatives in a Bar are always allowed to be more general becauſe moſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured, and eſpecially here, where the matter and perſon to which the words are applied, do ſufficiently reſtrain and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the ſeeming uncertainty of it.</p>
               <pb n="102" facs="tcp:50172:58"/>
               <p>Nothing can be pretended to reduce this to a greater certainty, but the Canons or the Statute of 13 <hi>Eliz. cap.</hi> 12. or other Laws of the ſame nature, 1 Canons of King <hi>Jac.</hi> 1. made in 1602. and they were made purſuant to Canons made, 1562. by which, no Man was to be admitted, <hi>niſi rationem fidei juxta Articulos Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligionis in Synodo Epiſcoporum &amp; Cleri Anno,</hi> 1562. <hi>approbatos La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine reddere &amp; eandem Scripturae teſtimonio Corroborare poſſit Can.</hi> 3, 4. <hi>Conditiones in ordinandis requiſit',</hi> this is merely a Negative injunction on the Biſhop never to confer Orders upon any Man that cannot do this, it is not mandatory upon him to ordain e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Man that can do this, nor does it any way leſſen or diminiſh the Authority or Judgment of the Ordinary in Examination of the fitneſs and Learning requiſite.</p>
               <p>So is the Statute of 13 <hi>Eliz.</hi> the ſame induces an incapacity on thoſe that ſhall not ſubſcribe the Articles, but it leaves all things elſe to the Eccleſiaſtical Law; neither the Canon nor the Statute are Derogatory from the Old Eccleſiaſtical Law, they both leave it <hi>in Statu quo</hi> to the Eccleſiaſtical Judges; no Man will pretend that theſe are a Repeal of the Statute of <hi>Articuli Cleri;</hi> ſo that the Law remained as it did with more Latitude indeed to the Biſhop, but not with more favour to the Clerk.</p>
               <p>They objected, that here was not convenient notice to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron, and the uſual pleading of it is the ſame day.</p>
               <p>But ſurely that's well enough, and ſo was it held by all the Jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges that favoured their ſide in this caſe, and 'tis apparent, that he had above four Months time to have preſented another, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, the Judges declared below, that if not a convenient time, it ought to have come on their ſide, but they admit notice by their Replication, and inſiſt upon his Orders as an Eſtoppel to ſay that he was Illiterate.</p>
               <p>They pretend, That he is ſtill under the Biſhop's Juriſdiction, and that he may deprive him for the ſame Cauſe, if ſufficient, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Inſtitution, but that's a great miſtake; for, there may be a cauſe of Refuſal, which is not of Deprivation, for, he may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Learned that was not ſo, and beſides, the Rule is falſe, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter induction, they would then be diſcourſing about Freehold, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> a Man may be refuſed, becauſe <hi>non compos,</hi> but he cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived for that Cauſe, though the Biſhop may provide a Curate, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to the pretence of ſix Months notice, from the time of the Refuſal, 'twas never inſiſted on at the Bar in <hi>C. B.</hi> or <hi>B. R.</hi> and the Judge who doubted, did only ſay, he was not fully ſatisfied with the current Opinion of the Books; his doubt aroſe upon this, That the cauſe of Refuſal was not within the Partron's knowledge. Suppoſe the Man had not Epiſcopal Orders, but pretended to them, and the Patron knew nothing of the matter, ſhould this Preſentation prevent lapſe, and the reſt were all of another Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and the Books are full to this effect, for the Patron ought to preſent a Man qualified, otherwiſe 'tis as no Preſentation, and then lapſe in courſe. Suppoſe he had preſented a mere <hi>laicus,</hi> 'tis
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:50172:58"/>as none; ſuppoſe he had preſented a Woman, as <hi>idonea perſona,</hi> 'tis as none; and theſe inſtances may ſeem Trivial, but our Books do mention them.</p>

               <p>Upon the whole, the Queſtion is, whether a Court of Law ſhall Repeal the Statute of <hi>Articuli Cleri,</hi> whether the Plea ſhall be adjudged ill, which is in the very words of that Statute; when the ſame Fact was never pleaded otherwiſe, nay, when it hath been pleaded thus often times, and never excepted againſt till now.</p>
               <p>Wherefore it was prayed that the Judgment might be Rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</p>
               <p>On the other ſide 'twas argued, That the Biſhop's Plea below, was too general, and the Plaintiffs Replication good; that his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Ordained a Prieſt, and a Licenſed Preacher is enough, that this is an Anſwer to the Allegation of the <hi>Minus Literatus,</hi> his being a Prieſt is a kind of a ſuperſedeas to his Examination, that there was no Learning requiſite to his having a Cure of Souls, which was not Antecedently neceſſary to his receiving of Orders: That he ought not to be admitted into Orders, unleſs he be aſſured of or named to ſome Curacy, all which, ſuppoſes the Qualifications Requiſite for a Benefice with Cure of Souls; then 'twas urged, that here was not notice ſufficient, for 'tis not till many days after the Refuſal, for this might have put <hi>Hele</hi> the Patron beyond the poſſibility of making a new Preſentation: And in all pleadings of this ſort, the notice is generally alledged to be the ſame day, or within a day or two at the moſt; That certainly it ought to be with convenient notice. But then it was urged, That the ſix Months ought not to be from the Death of the laſt Incumbent; if there be a perſon Criminal preſented, which the Patron doth or may know, as well as the Biſhop, there the ſix Months muſt be from the Death; but if it be upon a refuſal for a Cauſe which lies only in the Biſhop's knowledge, then it muſt be only from the notice, and that notice ought to be perſonal; but if the Months incur from the Death, the notice ſhould be in conveient time, and what that is, the Court muſt Judge.</p>
               <p>Then it was urged from <hi>Speccot</hi>'s Caſe, That this Plea is too general and uncertain, that a Temporal right being concerned, the Biſhop ought to have ſet forth more particularly and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly the cauſe of his Refuſal, 8 <hi>Rep.</hi> 68. the certain cauſe of a Divorſe muſt be ſhewn, 11 <hi>Hen.</hi> 7. 27. 2 <hi>Leon.</hi> 169. The Ordinary is a Judge only of the matter of Fact, if true, not if this matter pretended be a cauſe of Refuſal, he ought to alledge that ſo particularly, as to manifeſt it to the Court, in which the Suit depends; That 'tis a legal cauſe of Refuſal. He is not a Judge, whether <hi>Hodder</hi>'s inſufficiency in any one point of Learning be a
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:50172:59"/>good cauſe of Refuſal; for, if it ſhould be ſo, the Temporal Right of Patronage would be very precarious. The Court ought to have enough before them, whereon to Judge of the Cauſe, as well as that on Iſſue may be joyned and tried; here 'tis only ſaid that he is leſs ſufficient, not that he is altogether illiterate; this will put it in the Power of the Ordinary to refuſe for want of knowledge in any Learning as he thinks fit, as Mathematicks or Anatomy, without which, a Man may be well Qualified to be the Rector of a Benefice, and the conſequence of ſuch Opinion will be much to the prejudice of Lay Patrons; that certainty in Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ought to be encouraged for the prevention of the exerciſe of Arbitrary diſcretionary Power, that the Wiſdom of the Common-Law is to reduce things to ſingle Queſtions, that the Determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon them may be plain, and certain, and known, and the reaſons of ſuch Determinations may appear, which cannot well be done, if general Allegations or Pleadings be countenanced, for which; and other Reaſons urged by the Counſel, who argued with the Judgment, 'twas prayed that the Judgment might be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed.</p>
               <p>It was replied on behalf of the Plaintiff, in the Writ of Error, that the Books were very plain, that the ſix Months were to incur from the Death of the Incumbent, and then, if there were not notice in convenient and due time, in order to enable the Patron to preſent again, that this ought to come on the other ſide.</p>
               <p>That to require Learning in Preſentees to Benefices, would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the Honour of the Church, nay, of the Nation in general. That every Man who knew this Preſentee and his Ignorance, even as to the Latin Tongue, muſt acknowledge, that the Reverend Prelate who refuſed him, had done worthily, and becoming the Character of his Order, Family, and Perſon, and therefore 'twas prayed that the Judgment ſhould be Reverſed, and it was Rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</p>

            <p>WRIT, of Error on a Judgment in Ejectment in the <hi>King</hi>'s-<hi>Bench,</hi> for certain Lands in <hi>Hamp-Shire;</hi> the Declaration was upon the Demiſe of <hi>Francis Cockey:</hi> The Verdict finds, that <hi>William Horne</hi> and <hi>Ann</hi> his Wiſe were ſeized of the Lands in Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, in their Demeſne as of Fee in Right of the Wife, that they made and executed a Deed, Covenanting to Levy a Fine thereof, to the uſe of the Heirs of the ſaid <hi>William Horne,</hi> lawfully begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:50172:59"/>and to be begotten on the Body of the ſaid <hi>Ann</hi> his Wife, and for default of ſuch Iſſue, then to the uſe of the right Heirs of the ſaid <hi>William Horne</hi> for ever, and a Fine was Levied accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly to theſe uſes; that <hi>William</hi> and <hi>Ann</hi> were ſeized, <hi>prout Lex poſtulat,</hi> that they had Iſſue, <hi>William Horne</hi> their Son, who Died without Iſſue in the Life of <hi>William</hi> and <hi>Ann,</hi> that ſhe Died, and <hi>William</hi> the Father, and Husband Survived her, that then he Died without Iſſue, that the leſſor of the Plaintiff is Siſter and Heir of the ſaid <hi>William Horne,</hi> that after his Death, ſhe entred and was ſeized <hi>prout Lex poſtulat,</hi> that <hi>Elizabeth, Joanna,</hi> and others, were Co-heirs of the ſaid <hi>Ann,</hi> that their Eſtate and Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt came by mean conveyances to the Defendant <hi>Speed;</hi> That he was ſeized <hi>prout Lex poſtulat,</hi> that the Leſſor of the Plaintiff en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered and Ouſted the ſaid <hi>Speed,</hi> and made the Demiſe in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration, and that the Plaintiff entered and was Poſſeſſed, till the Defendant entered upon him, and Ouſted him: And if it ſhall appear to the Court, that the Deſenant's entry was lawful, they find the Defendant not Guilty, and if, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> upon this ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Verdict, Judgment was given in B. R. for the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant.</p>
            <p>And now it was Argued on the behalf of the Plaintiff, in the Writ of Error, that this Judgment was Erroneous, and ought to be Reverſed, for that theſe Lands belonged to the Heirs of the Husband by force of this Deed and Fine; that this was in the Caſe of an Uſe, which was to be conſtrued as much according to the intent of the Parties as a will; That if by any conſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, that intent could be fulfilled, it ought: That the intent of the parties here was plain to give this Eſtate to the Husband and his Heirs, that uſes are to be governed by Equity, and that therefore the meaning of the perſons concerned, was to be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued; That the Woman intended to take nothing her ſelf, nor to reſerve any thing, but to part with the whole: That here was an uſe by implication in the Husband, tho' none could reſult back to the Husband, becauſe he had none before; but that in this caſe as in that of a Will, an uſe might by implication very well be raiſed to the Husband, and then this might be good by way of Remainder, after the Death of the Husband; or create an Eſtate Tail in him, by coupling the uſe implied to him for Life, with that to the Heirs of his Body; and that if it were not ſo, then that it was good as a ſpringing contingent uſe to the Heirs of the Body of the Husband, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and that in the mean time till that Contingency happened, the ſame was to the uſe of the Wife and her Heirs; And that this Conſtruction contradicted no Rule of Law; That it was no more than was allowed in caſe of a Will, by way of Executory Deviſe, according to <hi>Pell</hi> and <hi>Brown</hi>'s Caſe, in 2 <hi>Cro.</hi> that the Eſtate ſhould remain in the Wife and her Heirs, during the Life of the Husband, that this was never deſigned to take effect as an uſe to be veſted immediately, and it was no more then if the Deed had declared the uſe to be after the expiration
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:50172:60"/>of twenty Years, or at other future time, to the Heirs of the Body of <hi>William Horne,</hi> and for default of ſuch Iſſue, to his right Heirs, and that ſuch time had happened, the uſe would have ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted in the Heirs of his Body, or in his right Heirs, if he had Died before that time: That 'tis true, there muſt be a perſon ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of taking at the time when the Contingency happens, and ſo there was here, at the time of his Death; That it could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be intended that the Heirs ſhould take immediately, for that then there was no ſuch perſon in being, there could be no Heirs during his Life: That this was like the Caſe of <hi>Webb,</hi> and Sir <hi>Caeſar Cranmer,</hi> where the Truſt of the Eſtate during the Life of the Duke of <hi>Southampton,</hi> was adjudged to remain in the Heirs of the Deviſor; the Duke himſelf not being capable to take it; That here being no perſon able to take under this Deed and Fine during the Husband's Life, it ſhall be conſtrued to remain as it was before, till that Life ends, and then the uſe ought to take ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect: for otherwiſe, both the Deed and Fine are to no purpoſe, they are all in vain, and the intent of the parties to it is defeated. And there were Cited the Lord <hi>Paget</hi>'s Caſe, in 1 <hi>Anderſon,</hi> and <hi>Woodlett,</hi> and <hi>Denny,</hi> 2 <hi>Crook</hi> 439. and 1 <hi>Leon</hi> 256.</p>
            <p>On the other ſide, it was argued with the Judgment, that this Deed and Fine can raiſe no uſe, to the Heirs of the Husband, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Rules of Law. It was inſiſted, That if Husband and Wiſe do levy a fine of the Wife's Land, and no uſes are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, or ſuch uſes are declared, as are void and can never take effect; ſuch Fine is to the uſe of the Wife and her Heirs, that in ſuch caſe the Eſtate remins' as it was, or if the Fine Operates any thing it ſhall be for the benefit of the party to whom it did belong before.</p>
            <p>Then it was urged, That this was deſigned to raiſe an uſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to the Heirs of the, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and that there was no perſon capable of taking at the time of levying this Fine, the common Maxim in the Law proving it, <hi>quod nemo eſt heres Viventis;</hi> that the name and nature of an Heir import a ſucceſſor after Death, that this being deſigned to raiſe an uſe, <hi>ex preſenti,</hi> and no perſon being capable of taking at that time, the ſame muſt be void: That this is the caſe of a Deed, executed in the Life-time of the parties, and not a Will, where large allowances are often made in favour of ſuppoſed intentions, by reaſon that perſons are often ſurprized by Sickneſs, and preſumed to want the aſſiſtance of Counſel, but the Rules of Law are always allowed to govern in Conſtruction of Deeds. Then it was urged, that nothing was ever deſigned to the Husband himſelf by this; that no words in the Deed can favour ſuch a preſumption, that this muſt either work as an Eſtate in preſent, or by way of remainder; if the latter then by the known Rules of Law, there muſt be a particular Eſtate to ſupport it, and ſuch particular Eſtate muſt be either expreſſed or implied; here is none expreſſed, and if implied, it muſt be in the Wife, and if in her, then ſhe dying before the Husband, her
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:50172:60"/>particular Eſtate did determine before the remainder could take place, and conſequently by all the Rules of Law, it can never take place; and no particular Eſtate can be implied, in or for the Husband, for that there is nothing ſaid ſhewing ſuch intent, and if the Conſtruction of Law be to prevail, then as was urged before, that is in favour of the Wife. But here, it was plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſigned to take effect immediately, and therefore void, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there was no perſon in being, capable of taking at the time the Eſtate was intended to veſt, and no uſes are to be executed by the State, which are limitted againſt the Rules of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Law, <hi>Chudleigh</hi>'s Caſe, 1 <hi>Rep.</hi> 129. if the limitation of an uſe be at this day to <hi>A.</hi> for Years, and afterwards to the uſe of the Heirs or Wife of <hi>B.</hi> which ſhall be, this is void, becauſe 'twould have been void, if limitted, in poſſeſſion, <hi>Dyer</hi> 190. the Earl of <hi>Bedford</hi>'s Caſe in <hi>Popham,</hi> 3, 4. and 82. reſolved in like manner to be void, becauſe would have been ſo in an Eſtate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed at Common-Law: And, all that can be objected, is, that then this is all void, which is no more than may be pretended upon every imperfect conveyance, but here the Caſe is in a Court of Law, and the Defendant is a Purchaſer who hath been Thirty Years in Poſſeſſion, tho' that doth not appear in the Caſe.</p>
            <p>And it was ſaid, That as to the Notion of a ſpringing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingent uſe, 'tis hardly intelligible in it ſelf, and by no means ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable to this Caſe, becauſe here are no words in this Deed, that carry any relation to a future time or Contingency, and the Objection is only this, That the Conveyancer was miſtaken in his Judgment, or that the parties knew not what they meant, or that they meant to create ſuch an Eſtate, and in ſuch a manner, as the Law will not allow; and neither of theſe are Reaſons ſufficient to prevail for the Reverſing of a Judgment given according to the Rules of Law, by which Men's Inheritances have all along been governed, and upon which, many Eſtates do now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend.</p>
            <p>'Twas further urged, That the contrary Opinion, which muſt be advanced to annul this Judgment, would reder the Law and Men's Conveyances, as doubtful and uncertain as laſt Wills and Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and ſubmit Men's Titles to the Arbitrary Power and Will of thoſe that ſhall Judge of them; It is to impower them to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe intentions where not expreſſed, and to raiſe uſes by Implica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, where they were never deſigned: And in ſhort, 'twill de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy all the difference between good and bad Conveyances, and enable Men to limit uſes and raiſe Eſtates contrary to, and in dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent manner from what the Law hath hitherto allowed; it will render Purchaſes more uncertain than they are at preſent, and that's more than enough already, and the conſequence muſt be to produce a confuſion in property, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> wherefore, upon the whole, it was prayed, That the Judgment might be affirmed, and it was affirmed accordingly.</p>

            <p>APpeal from a Decree in <hi>Chancery:</hi> The Caſe in ſhort was this; That <hi>Peter Crooke</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth</hi> his Wife, who was Siſter of the half Blood to <hi>George Watts,</hi> claimed to have an equal ſhare with <hi>John Watts</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth Camfield,</hi> who were Brother and Siſter of the whole Blood to the Deceaſed, of his Perſonal E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate; and a Decree was made in <hi>Chancery</hi> in favour of <hi>Crooke</hi> and his Wife.</p>
            <p>It was argued on behalf of the Appellants, That the half Blood ought to have but a half ſhare: That in the Caſe of Inheritances, the whole Blood was preferred; and that, tho' ſuch Rule could not govern intirely in this Caſe, yet it ſhewed which ought to have the preference; that the true Reaſon of Diſtribution was this, The Law was to give in like manner, as he might reaſonably be ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed willing to have given his Eſtate, in caſe he had made a Will, and had not been ſurpriſed by a ſudden Death; that every Man was ſuppoſed to favour his next of Kin; that the Statute of Diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions did the ſame thing; and then that the whole Blood was near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Kin, becauſe did partake of both the Stocks from whence he came; that the Relation or Kindred in this Caſe intirely came from the Parents; that this was not an Alliance by his own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract as Marriage, or the like; that the Inclination was ſuppoſed to ariſe to them from the Natural Love he bore to the Common Anceſtors; that ſuch Inclination could never be ſuppoſed equal, where the Party was only of the half Blood: And much to this effect, and many Arguments drawn from the Civil Law, were urged in favour of the Appellant, and ſeveral Preſidents cited, where it had been judged ſince the Statute for the half Blood to have but a half ſhare, by Sir <hi>Richard Lloyd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the other ſide it was argued, That the half Blood is as near a Kin to the Inteſtate, as the whole Blood, and ought to have an equal Share of the Perſonal Eſtate, with the whole Blood; that the Party muſt be preſumed equally inclined to each Parent; that the Brother of the half Blood was as much a Brother as one of the whole; that the whole Blood was preferrable in Deſcents, but that was only upon account of a Maxim in the Law; whereas here they are equally of Kin; the whole Blood is no more a Brother than the half; in the ſame Relation there can be no difference or degree; it might as well be pretended to have a difference allowed upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of Seniority; that Opinions and Practiſe had been with the Decrees; that this hath been taken to be the Law in <hi>Weſtminſter-hall.</hi> Before the Statute, 'twas held that a Siſter of the half Blood is in equal degree with the whole, <hi>Brown verſus Wood, Allen</hi>'s <hi>Rep.</hi> 36.

The like was in the Caſe of <hi>Stapleton</hi> and the Lord <hi>Merion</hi> againſt the Lord <hi>Sherrard</hi> and his Lady in <hi>Chancery</hi> by Judge <hi>Windham,</hi> 13 <hi>June</hi> 1683. the Caſe was thus, <hi>Robert Stapleton</hi> had a Siſter of the whole Blood, and a Brother and Siſter of the half Blood, and died Inteſtate: Adminiſtration was granted to his Wife the Lady <hi>Sherrard,</hi> who claimed a Moiety of the Perſonal Eſtate by the Cuſtom of the Province of <hi>York,</hi> and a quarter of the other Moiety by force of the Act for Diſtribution of Inteſtates Eſtates, and adjudged that the Wife ſhould have only one Moiety, and the other Moiety to be divided equally between the Brothers and Siſters both of the whole and half Blood. This Cauſe was Reheard the Seventh of <hi>May</hi> 1685. by the Lord <hi>Guilford,</hi> upon the Certificate of his Grace the Lord Archbiſhop, to whom it was referred to certifie the Cuſtom of the Province of <hi>York;</hi> who certified that the Wife ſhall have only a Moiety, and the other Moiety ſhall be divided amongſt the next of Kindred, and adjudged that the half Blood ſhall have an equal Share with the whole, and ſo the former De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree was confirmed.</p>
            <p>The ſame was adjudged by Mr. Juſtice <hi>Charlton, June</hi> 30. 1685. in the Caſe of <hi>Pullen</hi> and his Wife againſt <hi>Serjeant,</hi> in the Court of <hi>Chancery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The like was, amongſt other things, declar'd and decreed by the Lord <hi>Jeſſryes, Febr.</hi> 19. 1686. in the Caſe of the late Lord <hi>Winchelſea</hi> againſt <hi>Noraliff</hi> and <hi>Wentworth;</hi> upon which Hearing were preſent and aſſiſting the then Lord Chief Baron <hi>Atkyns,</hi> and Mr. Juſtice <hi>Lutwich;</hi> and ſo was it <hi>Nov.</hi> 20. 1689. between <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phens</hi> and <hi>Throgmorton</hi> in <hi>Chancery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It hath likewiſe been held ſo in the Eccleſiaſtical Court, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly adjudged by Sir <hi>Richard Raynes</hi> upon Solemn Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by the moſt eminent Counſel, both of the Civil and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law, in the Caſe of <hi>James Storey, Febr.</hi> 26. 1685. and in the Caſe of <hi>George Hawles,</hi> by the ſame Judge, upon <hi>June</hi> 1. 1687.</p>
            <p>Then it was urged, That the Statute of <hi>Jac.</hi> 2. for reviving and continuance of ſeveral Acts of Parliament therein mentioned, proves this; for 'tis enacted, <hi>That if after the Death of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, any of his Children ſhall die inteſtate, without Wife or Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:50172:62"/>in the life time of the Mother, every Brother and Siſter, and the Repreſentatives of them, ſhall have an equal ſhare;</hi> and that a Brother of the half Blood, is a Brother to the Inteſtate as well as a Brother of the whole Blood, and therefore ought to have a ſhare, and an equal ſhare with the reſt. And upon conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all thoſe Preſidents, and there being no Practiſe againſt it, except that of Sir <hi>Richard Lloyd</hi>'s, it was prayed that the Decree might be confirmed, and it was confirmed.</p>

            <p>A Writ of Error and Petition in Parliament. The Caſe below was thus: <hi>William Bridgman</hi> brings an Aſſize for the Office of chief Clerk for inrolling of Pleas in the Court of <hi>King's Bench;</hi> and the Plaintiff declares that the Office of chief Clerk for inrolling of Pleas in the Court of <hi>King's Bench,</hi> was time out of mind granted and grantable by the Kings and Queens of this Realm; and that King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, by Letters Patents un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Great Seal of <hi>England,</hi> Dated the Second of <hi>June,</hi> in the Five and twentieth Year of his Reign, (after a Recital that <hi>Robert Henley</hi> and <hi>Samuel Wightwick</hi> were duly admitted to this Office for their Lives) granted this Office (upon the Petition of <hi>Eliott</hi>) to <hi>Silas Titus,</hi> ſo ſoon as it ſhould become void; and that <hi>Wight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick</hi> was dead, and <hi>Titus</hi> had ſurrendred his Patent, did, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of Service done by the Earl of <hi>Arlington,</hi> grant this Office to the Plaintiff and his Heirs, for the Lives of the Earl of <hi>Arlington,</hi> Duke of <hi>Grafton</hi> and Dutcheſs of <hi>Grafton,</hi> and the lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger liver of them, from and after the Death, Forfeiture, or Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render of Sir <hi>Robert Henley,</hi> and that Sir <hi>Robert Henly</hi> was dead, and that thereupon the Plaintiff became ſeized, and was ſeized of the Office till the Defendants did diſſeize him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Defendants pleaded that they did not wrong or diſſeize the Plaintiff.</p>
            <p>Upon the Trial of this General Iſſue at the Bar of the <hi>King's-Bench,</hi> before the three puiſne Judges, the Chief Juſtice then ſitting near the Defendant's Counſel upon a Chair uncovered, the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff gave in Evidence the Letters Patents of 2 <hi>June,</hi> 25 <hi>Car.</hi> 2. Then it was propoſed by the Counſel for the Defendant, That they would prove their Allegation, that the Office was anciently granted by the Kings and Queens of <hi>England,</hi> as was declared; but no Evidence was given beſides this Patent of <hi>Car.</hi> 2.</p>
            <p>Then the Counſel for the Defendant waving the juſt Exception which they might have taken to the Plaintiff's Grant as to him and his Heirs, which ought not to be of ſuch an Office, for that by that means it might come to an Infant: They inſiſted upon the meer right of Granting the ſaid Office, <hi>viz.</hi> that it was not gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table by the Crown, but was an Office belonging to the Chief Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of the <hi>King's Bench,</hi> and grantable by him.</p>
            <pb n="112" facs="tcp:50172:63"/>
            <p>Then to prove this, it was ſhewn, That this Officer is to Inroll Pleas between Party and Party only, and had nothing to do with any Pleas of the Crown or Criminal Matters; that all the Rolls and Records in this Office were in the Cuſtody of the Chief Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice; that all the Writs to certifie or remove the Records in this Clerk's Office, are directed to the Chief Juſtice; and from the nature of the Imployment, 'twas inſiſted, that in truth he was but the Chief Juſtices Clerk, and that conſequently the ſame muſt be granted by the Chief Juſtice.</p>
            <p>And for further proof, it was ſhown by the Records of the Court, that for the ſpace of Two hundred thirty five years paſt, this Office when void, had been granted by the Chief Juſtice, and enjoy'd accordingly under ſuch Grants. In <hi>Trin.</hi> 36 <hi>Hen.</hi> 6. <hi>Rot.</hi> 36. <hi>inter placita Reg. Anno Dom.</hi> 1458.

Chief Juſtice of that Court (to whom of right it doth belong to grant that Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to whomſoever he pleaſeth, whenſoever that Office ſhall be void, during the time that the ſaid Sir</hi> John Forteſcue <hi>ſhall be Chief Juſtice) and that Office doth reſign and relinquiſh to the uſe of</hi> William Brome; <hi>and the ſaid Chief Juſtice doth accept the ſaid Surrender, and doth the ſame day grant the ſaid Office to the ſaid</hi> William Brome, <hi>who is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently admitted into the ſaid Office for his Life, and ſworn accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly.</hi>

            <p>And it was obſerved on behalf of the Defendant, That in all theſe Records produced and read in Court, after the mention of the Surrender to the Chief Juſtice, there are theſe words, <hi>To whom of right it doth belong to grant that Office whenſoever it ſhall be void.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was then further inſiſted on and proved, That there are in the nature of Clerks, three conſiderable Officers of the Court of <hi>King's Bench:</hi> The firſt and chiefeſt is the Clerk of the Crown, called ſometimes <hi>Coronator &amp; Attornat' Domini Regis, &amp;c.</hi> his Buſineſs is to draw all Indictments, Informations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in Pleas of the Crown. This Officer being the chief Clerk in Court, is always made by Patent under the Great Seal. The ſecond Officer is this, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thonotary or chief Clerk for inrolling Pleas between Party and Party in Civil Matters: He and his Under-Clerks do inroll all Declarations, Pleadings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in Civil Cauſes, eſpecially where the Proceedings are by Bill. This Clerk files in his Office, all Bills, Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and all the Writs of this Court in Civil Matters, are made by him and his Under-Clerks, and teſted by the Chief Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice. And he hath the cuſtody of all Returns of <hi>Elegits, Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Scire Facias's,</hi> and the filing of all <hi>Villes;</hi> every of which are in the Eye and Judgment of the Law, in the hands of the Chief Juſtice, whoſe Clerk this Officer is.</p>
            <p>The third is the <hi>Cuſtos Brevium,</hi> who keeps all the Rolls and Records of Judgments in this Court, which are alſo ſaid to be in the cuſtody of the Chief Juſtice: And this Office, when void, is in his Gift and Diſpoſal.</p>
            <pb n="114" facs="tcp:50172:64"/>
            <p>It was further ſhewn on the behalf of the Defendants, That in the Statute of <hi>Edw.</hi> 6. againſt the Sale of Offices, there is a <hi>Salvo</hi> to the two Chief Juſtices and Judges of Aſſize, to diſpoſe of the Offices in their diſpoſition, as they uſed formerly. And ever ſince that Statute, theſe two Offices of chief Clerk to inroll the Pleas, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the <hi>Cuſtos Brevium,</hi> have without controul been diſpoſed by the Chief Juſtice of the Court of <hi>King's Bench.</hi> And it is alſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, That in the Grant of this Office to Mr. <hi>Bridgman</hi> the Plaintiff, it is recited that <hi>Henly</hi> and <hi>Wightwick</hi> were <hi>debito modo</hi> admitted to this Office, and yet they never had any Grant from the Crown, nor any other Grant, except that from the Chief Juſtice before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.</p>
            <p>Then to prove the Defendant's Title to the Office, the Grant of the now Chief Juſtice to them for their Lives, was produced, and read, and proved, that they were admitted and ſworn.</p>
            <p>To anſwer all this Evidence, there was produced the Copy of an Act of Parliament which was made in 15 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. to this effect: <hi>It is conſented, that if any of the Offices aforeſaid</hi> (which are other great Offices mentioned in the Act) <hi>or the Controller or chief Clerk in the</hi> Common Bench <hi>or</hi> King's Bench, <hi>by Death or other Caſe be ouſted of their Office, the King, with the conſent of the great Men,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ſhall put another fit perſon in ſuch Office.</hi> From whence the Plaintiff's Counſel would have inferred, That the King had a right to grant this Office, and that this Act was declaratory of ſuch his Right; and that all the Grants from the Chief Juſtices ever ſince that Act, were but Uſurpations on the Crown; and that no U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of granting it by the Chief Juſtices, could prevail againſt the King's Right.</p>
            <p>To this it was replied, That the Act was repealed, as did appear by the Record it ſelf, as well as by their own Copy produced. And for a further Anſwer, 'twas ſaid, That the Office in queſtion was not the Office mentioned in that Act, for that Act mentions the chief Clerk of the <hi>King's Bench,</hi> which is the Clerk of the Crown, and ſo called in the 2 <hi>H.</hi> 4. the <hi>Statute a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Extortion;</hi> and he is in reality the chief Clerk in that Court, and hath precedency of this Officer both in Court and elſewhere: And that this Officer is not called chief Clerk in the <hi>King's Bench,</hi> altho' he is the chief for inrolling of Pleas Civil in that Court: And the conſtant. Uſage explains the meaning of that Act. And that the Officer called <hi>chief Clerk</hi> was meant to be the Clerk of the Crown; for that that Office hath been always granted by Letters Patents, according to that Act: And the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice in queſtion was never enjoyed one day by virtue of a Grant from the Crown.</p>
            <p>The Defendants did further inſiſt, That it was a Scandalous Imputation upon all thoſe chief Juſtices, who were Perſons of Probity and Virtue, and had clear Reputations, to ſurmiſe that they impoſed and uſurped upon the Crown, as they muſt all have done, if the right of granting this Place be in the King: And
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:50172:64"/>Sir <hi>Robert Heath,</hi> that was the King's Attorney, took a Grant of the Office in queſtion from the Chief Juſtice; and upon his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittance, the right of the Chief Juſtice to grant it is affirmed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Record.</p>
            <p>Then all this Evidence on both ſides being given, and the ſame being ſtrong on the Defendants behalf, the Court propoſed to the Plaintiff's Counſel to be Nonſuit, which they would not, but prayed the Court to direct the Jury, ſome of them ſaying that they would take another Courſe: And then the Court did briefly ſum up the ſame, and particularly the Evidence of the Act, 15 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. and what was urged from it by the Plaintiff, and the Anſwers made thereto, and left the Matter to the Jury upon the whole. The Jury withdrew, and after ſome time, gave a Verdict for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendants.</p>
            <p>Upon this Verdict the Counſel for the Plaintiff prayed leave to bring in a Bill of Exceptions, and produced in Court, and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred to the three Judges to be ſealed, a Parchment Writing in form of ſuch a Bill; in which, after a Recital of the Declaration, and Iſſue in the Cauſe, 'tis alledged, That the Plaintiff's Counſel pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced in Evidence the Grant of the Office to the Plaintiff; and that they ſhewed to the Court and Jury, that the Office is of the Grant of the Crown: And that to make out the Right of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second to grant this Office to the Plaintiff, they gave in Evidence the 15 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. which in the Bill is ſet out at large (and is in Subſtance, as is before ſet forth.) And 'tis further alledged in the Bill, That the Juſtices refuſed to allow, admit, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Allegations and Matters given in Evidence, as ſufficient to prove the Plaintiff's Title to this Office, by reaſon whereof the Jury found, That the Defendant did not diſſeize the Plaintiff; and prays that the Juſtices would put their Seals to it, according to the Statute of <hi>Weſtminster</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 31.</p>
            <p>The Juſtices upon reading this Bill, did refuſe to Seal it,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe 'tis aſſerted therein, That the Plaintiff's Counſel did ſhow that this Office was of the Gift and Grant of the King, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever it ſhould be void; whereas there was no ſuch Evidence to ſhow any ſuch Right in the King offered, or pretended to, beſides the Patent in queſtion, and the Act of <hi>Edw.</hi> 3.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That the Judges refuſed to allow, admit, and receive the Allegations and Matters given in Evidence for the Plaintiff, as ſufficient to maintain his Title; whereas they were given in Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and conſidered; and if it be meant, as a ſufficient Evidence to controul and over-rule all other, that doth not belong to the Court in Trials to determine, unleſs referred to them upon demurrer to Evidence, but is the proper buſineſs of the Jury; and if the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty be aggrieved, the Remedy is an Attaint. Nor can it be pretended that the Defendants Evidence was admitted to over-rule the Record
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:50172:65"/>produced, becauſe no Objection was made to the Defendants Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence at the Trial, and the ſame was all given before the Record of 15 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. was produced, and conſequently the Jury muſt conſider the force of it; for Evidence on both ſides being given, by the Law of <hi>England,</hi> the Deciſion of the Right belongs to the Jury; and the Act of <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. being repealed, 'tis no Matter of Law, but the moſt which could be made of it, was, that it was Evidence, which muſt be left to the Jury, together with the Defendants Evidence. But no Bill of Exception will lye in ſuch a Caſe by the Statute, when the Evidence given is admitted as Evidence, and left to a Jury; and where no Oppoſition was made to the Defendants Evidence, as here in this Caſe; and therefore in this Caſe a Bill of Excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on could not be warrantable, becauſe the Plaintiff's Evidence was not refuſed or over-ruled; nor was the Defendant's Evidence fit to be rejected, or ſo much as oppoſed by the Plaintiff. And as to the Allegations made by the Counſel, and not proved, thoſe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver could be an Exception. And for theſe and other Reaſons the Judges refuſed to Seal their Bill.</p>
            <p>Upon this a Writ of Error is brought, and a Petition was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited to the Lords Spiritual and Temporal in Parliament aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, in the Name of the Lady <hi>Iſabella</hi> Dutcheſs of <hi>Grafton,</hi> and <hi>William Bridgman</hi> her Truſtee, ſhowing that King. <hi>Charles</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond granted the Office in queſtion to <hi>W. B.</hi> for the Lives of <hi>Henry</hi> Earl of <hi>Arlington, Henry</hi> Duke of <hi>Grafton,</hi> and of the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioner the Lady <hi>Iſabella</hi> in Truſt for the Duke, his Executors and Adminiſtrators, to commence after the Death of Sir <hi>Robert Henly;</hi> that upon the death of Sir <hi>Robert Henly,</hi> the Petitioner by virtue of the ſaid Grant, was well intituled to the ſaid Office, but was interrupted in receiving the Profits by <hi>Rowland Holt</hi> Eſq; Brother to the Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Holt,</hi> and by <hi>Edward Coleman</hi> Gent. who pretended to be admitted thereto by ſome Grant from the Chief Juſtice; that thereupon an Aſſize was brought for the ſaid Office, which came to Trial; and the Petitioners Counſel inſiſted upon an Act of Parliament, proving the King to have the Right of granting the ſaid Office, which the Judges would not admit to be ſufficient to prove the King's Right to grant the ſame. That the Petitioners Counſel did thereupon pray the benefit of a Bill therein to be allowed, and ſealed by the Judges according to Law. And the Petitioner's Counſel, relying upon the ſaid Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament as ſufficient proof of the King's Right, duly tendred a Bill of Exceptions before Judgment in the Aſſize, which the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es upon the Trial ſaid they would Seal, yet when tendred to them in Court before Judgment, would not Seal the ſame. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon Judgment was entred againſt the Petitioners Title in the Aſſize by default of the Judges not allowing and ſealing the ſaid Bill, according to the Duty of their Office by Law, whereby they are hindred from making the Matter of the ſaid Bill part of the Record of the ſaid Judgment now brought and depending before your Lordſhips, upon a Writ of Error in Parliament, for reverſing
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:50172:65"/>the ſaid Judgment in the Aſſize, and ſo are precluded from ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the full benefit of the Law by the ſaid Writ of Error, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine, reverſe, and annul the ſaid Judgment: Wherefore the Petitioners prayed that their Lordſhips would be pleaſed to order the ſaid Judges, or ſome of them, to Seal the ſaid Bill of Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to the end the ſaid Caſe might (as by Law it ought) come intirely before their Lordſhips for Judgment, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon reading this Petition, 'twas ordered that the Lord Chief Juſtice, and the reſt of the Judges of the Court of <hi>King's Bench,</hi> ſhould have Copies of the Petition, and put in their Anſwer there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto in Writing on ..... next.</p>
            <p>At the Day appointed there was deliver'd an Anſwer in theſe, or the like words:
<q>
                  <hi>The Anſwer of</hi> William Dolben, William Gregory, <hi>and</hi> Giles Eyre <hi>Knights, three of their Majeſties Juſtices, aſſigned to hold Pleas in their Court of</hi> King's Bench <hi>at</hi> Weſtminſter, <hi>to the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition of the most noble</hi> Iſabella <hi>Dutcheſs of</hi> Grafton, <hi>and</hi> Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Bridgman, <hi>exhibited by them to your Lordſhips.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>THeſe Reſpondents by Proteſtation not owning or allowing any of the Matters of the Petition to be true, as they are therein alledged, and ſaving to themſelves the benefit of all the ſeveral Statutes herein after mentioned, and all the Right they have, as Members of the Body of the Commons of <hi>England,</hi> to defend themſelves upon any Trial that may be brought againſt them, for any thing done contrary to their Duty, as Judges, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the due Courſe of the Common Law, which Right they hold themſelves obliged to inſiſt upon, in anſwer to the ſaid Petition, think themſelves bound to ſhew, and offer to your Lordſhips conſideration,</p>
            <p>That the Petition is a Complaint againſt them for refuſing to Seal a pretended Bill of Exceptions, contrary to a Statute in that behalf, as the Petition pretends, without ſetting forth the tenour of the ſaid Statute, or what that pretended Bill was; whereas that Statute is the Statute of <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 31. and doth en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act, That if any impleaded before any Juſtices, doth offer an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, and pray the Juſtices to allow the ſame, and they refuſe ſo to do, the Party offering the Exception, is thereby to write it, and pray the Juſtices to Seal it, which they, or one of them, are thereby enjoyned to do: So that if the pretended Bill was duly tendred to theſe Reſpondents, and was ſuch as they were bound to Seal, theſe Reſpondents are anſwerable only for it by the Courſe of the Common Law, in an Action to be brought on that Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, which ought to be tried by a Jury of Twelve honeſt and lawful Men of <hi>England,</hi> by the Courſe of the Common Law, and not in any other manner.</p>
            <pb n="118" facs="tcp:50172:66"/>
            <p>And the Reſpondents further ſhew, and humbly offer to your Lordſhips conſideration, That the Petition is a Complaint in the nature of an Original Suit, charging thoſe Reſpondents with a Crime of a very high Nature, in acting contrary to the Duty of their Office, and ſo altogether improper for your Lordſhips Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination or Conſideration, not being any more triable by your Lordſhips then every Information or Action for breach of any Statute Law is, all which Matters are by the Common Law, and Juſtice of the Land, of Common Right to be tried by a Jury.</p>
            <p>And the Petition is wholly of a new Nature, and without any Example or Precedent, being to compel Judges, who are by the Law of the Land to act according to their own judgments, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Conſtraint or Compulſion whatſoever, and trenches upon all Mens Rights and Liberties, tending manifeſtly to deſtroy all Trials by Jury.</p>
            <p>And it is further manifeſt, That this Complaint is utterly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper for your Lordſhips Examination, for that your Lordſhips cannot apply the proper and only Remedy which the Law hath given the Party in this Caſe, which is by awarding Damages to the Party injured (if any Injury be done) for theſe are only to be aſſeſſed by a Jury. And they, theſe Reſpondents, are ſo far from apprehending they have done any wrong to the Petitioners in this Matter, that they humbly offer, with your Lordſhips leave, to wave any Priviledge they have, as Aſſiſtants to this Honourable Houſe, and appear <hi>gratis</hi> to any Suit that ſhall be brought againſt them, in <hi>Weſtminſter-hall,</hi> touching the Matter complained of in the Petition.</p>
            <p>And they further, with all humility, offer to your Lordſhips Conſideration, That as they are Judges, they are under the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Obligation of an Oath to do Juſtice (without reſpect of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons) and are to be ſuppoſed to have acted in this Matter with, and under a due regard to that Sacred Obligation; and therefore to impoſe any thing contrary upon them, may endanger the breaking of it, which they humbly believe your Lordſhips will be tender of.</p>
            <p>And they further humbly ſhew to your Lordſhips, That by a Statute made in the 25th of <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 4. it is enacted, That from thenceforth none ſhall be taken by Petition or Suggeſtion to the King, or his Councel, unleſs by Indictment or Preſentment of good and lawful People of the Neighbourhood, or by Proceſs by Writ Original at Common Law; and that none ſhall be put out of his Franchiſe or Freehold, but by the Courſe of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law. And by another Statute in the 28th of <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 3. it is expreſly provided that no Man ſhall be put out of his Lands and Tenements, nor impriſoned or diſinherited but by due Proceſs of Law. And by another Statute made in the 42 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 3. it is enacted, That no Man ſhall be put to anſwer, without Preſentment before Juſtices, or Matter of Record on due Proceſs and Original Writ, according to the old Law of the Land.</p>
            <pb n="119" facs="tcp:50172:66"/>
            <p>And the Reſpondents further ſay, That inaſmuch as the Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is a Complaint, in the nature of an Original Cauſe for a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed Breach of an Act of Parliament; which Breach (if any be) is only examinable and triable by the Courſe of the Common Law, and cannot be ſo in any other manner, and is in the Example of it dangerous to the Rights and Liberties of all Men, and tends to the Subverſion of all Trials by Juries, theſe Reſpondents con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive themſelves bound in Duty (with regard to their Offices, and in Conſcience to the Oaths they have taken) to crave the benefit of defending themſelves touching the Matter complained of in the Petition, by the due and known Courſe of the Common Law; and to rely upon the aforeſaid Statutes, and the Common Right they have of Free-born People of <hi>England,</hi> in Bar of the Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners any further proceeding upon the ſaid Petition, and humbly pray to be diſmiſſed from the ſame.</p>
            <p>Then it was after Debate ordered, That Counſel be heard at the Bar of the Houſe on the ſaid Petition.</p>
            <p>And afterwards upon the Day appointed for the hearing of Counſel, it was inſiſted on, in the behalf of the Petitioners, That here was a Right, and a Right proved, and no ways to come at it but this; that if a Bill of Exceptions be tendred and refuſed, this Houſe can command them to do it; that this proceeding of the Judges is to ſtifle the Matter of Law; the Writ upon the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute muſt be returnable here, and cannot be otherwiſe; that this follows the Judgment into Parliament; that this Houſe is to judge of every thing belonging to that Judgment; that if this cannot be done, there will be a failure of Juſtice; that there have been Writs of Error upon Judgments, with the Bill of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions annexed; that Damages to be recovered in an Action, gives no Reparation for the Office; that the Action muſt be brought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Judges, and ſo it muſt be a Dance in a Circle; that as to the Judges Oaths, the Juſtices of Peace are upon their Oaths, and yet they may be committed; that this is not fit for a Jury to try, Whether the Judges have done well or ill in refuſing to Seal this Bill of Exceptions: This Refuſal is the way to keep the Law within the Bounds or Walls of <hi>Weſtminſter-hall,</hi> and effectually to prevent its ever coming hither; that this was not a Complaint of the Judges; that as yet they would not accuſe them of a Crime, they only ſaid, <hi>fac hoc &amp; vive;</hi> that the Court of <hi>King's Bench</hi> below doth the ſame thing to the Judges in <hi>Ireland;</hi> they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand others, and ought to be commanded; that they themſelves ſend Mandatory Writs, as the Caſes are in <hi>Yelvert' &amp; Cro. Car.</hi> That the Lords had directed the Judges in many things; and ſo they did in <hi>Jeffrey Stanton</hi>'s Caſe; that by Command under the Privy Seal things have been done, which otherwiſe would not; and my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> was remanded to the <hi>Tower</hi> upon the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of that Caſe, 15 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. the Statute ſays that the Peers ſhall Examine; for by great Men are meant the Peers.</p>
            <pb n="120" facs="tcp:50172:67"/>
            <p>Then were urged certain Caſes, where the Lords had command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>Chancery</hi> to proceed ſpeedily, and to give Judgment, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Earl of <hi>Radnor</hi>'s Caſe; <hi>Englefield</hi> and <hi>Englefield,</hi> and other like Caſes were quoted; and from thence they argued the Power of the Lords to command the Judges to do the thing deſired.</p>
            <p>'Twas argued on the other ſide againſt the Petition to this ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, That this was a Cauſe of great conſequence, in reſpect of the Perſons concerned, as alſo of the Subject Matter, it being the Complaint of a Noble Peereſs againſt three of the Judges, before whom ſhe was lately a Suitor; and concerning the Juriſdiction of this Houſe: That this Petition was the moſt artificial which could be contrived to hinder the Juſtice of the Law, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure a Determination in prejudice of Two hundred thirty five years enjoyment; that it is deſigned to get a Cauſe to be heard and adjudged on a Writ of Error by the Evidence onone ſide only, or rather by that which was no Evidence at all, if the Copy produced at the Trial was true: for now upon the return of what they deſire, nothing of the Defendants Evidence would or could appear. When a Bill of Exceptions is formed upon the Statute, it ought to be upon ſome point of Law, either in admitting or denying of Evidence, or a Challenge, or ſome Matter of Law a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſing upon Fact not denied, in which either Party is over-ruled by the Court. If ſuch Bill be tendred, and the Exceptions in it are truly ſtated, then the Judges ought to ſet their Seal, in teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony that ſuch Exceptions were taken at the Trial: But if the Bill contain Matters falſe or untruly ſtated, or Matters wherein they were not over-ruled, then they are not obliged to affix the Seal; for that would be to command them to atteſt a falſity; a Bill is not to draw the whole Matter into Examination again; 'tis only for a ſingle point; and the truth of it can never be doubted after the Bill is ſealed; for the adverſe Party is conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from averring the contrary, or ſupplying an Omiſſion in it.</p>
            <p>This Bill was without Foundation; the Plaintiff was not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruled in any one Point of Law: 'Tis true, the Counſel deſired the Opinion of the Court after all the Defendant's Evidence had been heard, concerning their Record, and the Judges did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, that they thought it did not extend to the Office in queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but to the Clerk of the Crown, who is the chief Clerk in Court, and hath precedency; and the Grant of that Office by the King, both before and ſince that ſuppoſed Act, proves that to be meant, and not the Office in queſtion, which hath always been granted by the Chief Juſtice: and this was afterwards left to the Jury. Here was no cauſe for a Bill of Exceptions, the Judges at the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels deſire gave their Opinion upon the thing, but did not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rule them; for that the Act being repealed, could make no Point of Law, but only be Evidence for the Jury to conſider.</p>
            <pb n="121" facs="tcp:50172:67"/>
            <p>Beſides, this Act, tho' repealed, is inſerted in the Bill as an Act in force; And if an Act be ſet out, and no repeal appears, it muſt be underſtood to be in force; and if the Bill had been ſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it muſt have been taken as in force, and the Defendants could not here upon the Writ of Error have ſhewn the repeal, which was in the 17 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. and appeared ſo upon the Evidence; from whence 'twas inferred, That this Bill was too artificial. If any point of Law had ariſen upon the whole Evidence (and a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular point there was none) the whole ought to have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted in the Bill, or at leaſt all that which concerned that Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
            <p>If this ſhould be allowed, 'twould be in the power of any Counſel to deſtroy any Verdict; as in caſe of a Title by Deſcent from Father to Son, and a Will of the Father had been produced and proved at the Trial, and a Bill had been ſealed, only ſhewing the Seiſin and Deſcent, the Son muſt prevail, tho' he had no Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle. This is enough to ſhew that the Judges are not obliged; nay, are obliged, not to Seal this Bill.</p>
            <p>Then it was argued, That the preſent Complaint is beneath the Honour, and beſides the Juriſdiction of the Houſe of Peers; that this was a Complaint of a Default in the Judges, which cannot be tried in this place; that <hi>MagnaCharta</hi> was made for them as well as for others; that if they offend againſt any Rule of the Common Law, or particular Statute, whether in their Perſonal behaviour, or as Judges, they are triable only by their Peers; that Peers are only ſuch <hi>qui pari conditione &amp; lege vivunt;</hi> that the Crown and Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of <hi>England</hi> had ſo far exalted their Lordſhips in their State and Condition, that 'tis beneath them to judge or try Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; that all Powers and Priviledges in this Kingdom, even the higheſt, are circumſcrib'd by the Law, and have their limits: That this is a Complaint of a great Crime in the Judges, a Breach of their Oaths, and with the inſinuation of Partiality to one of themſelves; which if true, incurs loſs of their Offices, and Forfeiture of their Eſtates by Fine, and of their Liberty by Impriſonment; and all this to the King; beſides Damages to the Party grieved; and therefore it concerns them to have the benefit of the Law.</p>
            <p>That this comes not regularly into the Houſe; 'tis not any mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Advice to the King, nor of Priviledge, nor of Contempt to this Court, becauſe the Matter complained of was before any Judgment below, or any Juriſdiction could be attached here, by pretence of the Writ of Error. 'Tis brought hither by way of Complaint for a ſuppoſed Miſcarriage in <hi>Weſtminſter-hall,</hi> in a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Cauſe between <hi>Bridgman</hi> and <hi>Holt,</hi> two Commoners: It pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes the Lords to be proper Judges in the firſt Inſtance, for the hearing and puniſhing of all Offences committed by the Judges, and that in a Summary way upon a Petition, and without that due Proceſs of Law, which is eſtabliſhed under our Government.</p>
            <pb n="122" facs="tcp:50172:68"/>
            <p>Either this Refuſal is puniſhable, or not; If not, the Petition ought to be rejected: If it be, 'tis either by the Common Law, or by Act of Parliament; but neither do warrant this Practiſe of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioning; and the old Law is that, which paſt Ages have appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and that by which Juſtice is to be adminiſtred; and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is done by way of Judgment in a different manner than the Law allows, is againſt that Law.</p>
            <p>The proceeding in this manner is againſt the Conſent of the Reſpondents, for they have Pleaded to the Juriſdiction of this Houſe as to this matter, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and therefore it differs from all Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, where the Parties concerned have Anſwered the Complaint, and thereby ſubmitted the ſame to an Examination; and this will prevent the force of many preſidents which may be Cited on this occaſion. Some Perſons perhaps have from a confidence of Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, or from a ſlaviſh Fear, or private Policy, forborn to Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Power of their Superiors; but the Judges muſt betray their Reputation and their Knowledge of the Laws, if they ſhould own a Juriſdiction, which former times and their Predeceſſors were unacquainted with.</p>
            <p>'Tis neceſſary to anſwer the pretence of a failure of Juſtice, in caſe this method be Rejected; and therefore it muſt be obſerved, That our Law knows nothing of extraordinary means to redreſs a Miſchief, but that upon a defect of ordinary ones, recourſe is to be had to the Legiſlature, and to that only, either to explain and correct in reference to things paſt, or to provide remedies for the future. But here is a common eaſie means of relief, if there had been occaſion.</p>
            <p>By the Statute of <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> 2 <hi>cap.</hi> 31. In caſe the Judge re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſes, then a Writ to Command him, which is to iſſue out of Chancery, <hi>quod apponat ſigillum ſuum;</hi> and then a Writ to own or deny his Seal.</p>
            <p>By 2 <hi>Inſt.</hi> 426. the party grieved by the denial, may have a Writ upon the Statute, Commanding the ſame to be done, <hi>juxta formam Statuti, Reg.</hi> 182. <hi>Fitch. Natura brevium,</hi> 21. and 11 <hi>Hen.</hi> 4.51, 62, 63. there's the form of the Writ ſet out at large. It recites a ſurmiſe of an Exception taken and over-ruled, and it follows <hi>vobis precipimus, quod ſi ita eſt, tunc ſigilla veſtra appona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis. Si ita,</hi> 'tis conditional, if the Bill be true and duly tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, then this Writ, and if it be returned, <hi>quod non ita eſt,</hi> then an Action for a falſe return, and thereupon the ſurmiſe will be tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and if found to be ſo, Damages, and upon ſuch a Recovery, a peremptory Writ Commanding the ſame; that the Law is thus, ſeems plain; tho' no precedent can be ſhewn of ſuch a Writ 'tis only for this Reaſon, becauſe no Judge did ever refuſe to Seal a Bill of Exceptions, and none was ever refuſed, becauſe none was ever tendred like to this, ſo artificial and groundleſs: But that ſuch Actions lie upon this Statute, were Cited <hi>Regiſt.</hi> 174. <hi>Nat. Br.</hi> 10. and they are called Attachments, and Dama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges ſhall be to the Party and a Fine to the King; ſo it is in all Caſes of Statute Laws, which do either prohibit or Command the
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:50172:68"/>doing of a thing for the advantage of any perſon, ſuch perſon, if injured by a diſobedience to that Law is intitled to an Action, tho' the Statute doth not in expreſs words give one. 2 <hi>Inſt.</hi> 55.74.118.131. and the ſame holds in judicial proceedings, the Caſe of the <hi>Marſhalſeas,</hi> 10 <hi>Rep.</hi> 75. 4 <hi>Edw.</hi> 4.37. and the ſame Reaſon warrants the Action for a <hi>Scandal' Magnat':</hi> But perhaps 'twill be ſaid, that tho' an Action lies for a diſobedience to this Writ, yet the Writ not being returnable, no Action lies for a falſe return, and conſequently no peremptory Writ, and by conſequence there's no adequate remedy in caſe of an unjuſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſal; but to this it may be anſwered, That the Writ being Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional, 'tis a good Anſwer to it, that the Fact was not as is ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, and that return will juſtifie the Refuſal: And certainly ſuch return may be made; and if not, when the firſt Writ is proved to be true in all its Suggeſtions, by Judgment in an Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for not obeying it, the ſame Reaſon will warrant a perempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Writ; But whether this be thus, or not, it only argues an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection in the Law, proper for the notice of the Legiſlature, and will not juſtifie the method of proceeding, now attempted here in this place.</p>
            <p>It hath been Objected, That ſuch Proceedings are not like to be ſucceſsful, becauſe Judges ſtill are to try thoſe matters; but theſe are Reflections not Arguments, and our Conſtitution is foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on a Notion, that parity of Condition is the beſt Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a trier; and here muſt be a Jury to try the Fact, and they are ſubject to an Attaint, if their Verdict contradict the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence: And no direction of a Judge can excuſe them, for if it be a point of Law, they are not oblig'd to find a ſpecial Verdict, but may find a general one upon their own peril of an Attaint. Then.</p>
            <p>Either this is deſigned as a Criminal proceeding againſt the Judges, in order to Puniſhment, or as a Civil proceeding, for to gain Damages to the Party, or elſe neither one nor the other, but to have an Order Commanding the thing to be done; which if refuſed, then to have them compelled by Impriſonment, <hi>quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſque,</hi> &amp;c. neither of the firſt are pretended; and the laſt is not a Warrantble method, when the Law hath preſcribed a Writ in Chancery, and that's not proſecuted.</p>
            <p>Here cannot be tried the particular requiſites to ground ſuch an Order as they deſire, as whether the Evidence or Exception as ſtated, was offered at the Trial, or if offered, whether 'twas o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-ruled, nor whether the matter offered were believed, for if not believed, it makes no Evidence, and ſo can raiſe no point in Law; There can be no Jury impanelled to try this, nor can an Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue be directed hence for the trial of it.</p>
            <p>By this means, the Judges loſe the benefit of that legal Trial, by a Jury of their Peers, which is their fence and protection a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Power, Art, or Surprize; the beſt for indifference and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of Truth. The Inſtitution of the Law is cautions and wiſe in its proviſion for both. Challenges are admitted below;
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:50172:69"/>'tis derogatory to the Honour of this Court, to ſuppoſe it neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry here; but to have it in <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall,</hi> is however reckoned a Commoner's priviledge and Birth-right; there the Law is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by one, and the Fact is aſcertained by another; here both are in the ſame hands: Not that any Jealouſie can be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of miſchief by it in this Houſe, but the practice of it now may give preſident to future Reigns and Ages, in which there may be danger of a partiality.</p>
            <p>Below, there are by the Law appointed and provided particular Terms and days for doing Juſtice, and they are certain, the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances between them are known, according to the nature of the Suit; which capacitates the parties concerned, their Agents and Witneſſes, to be ready, and there can be no ſurprize.</p>
            <p>It muſt not be preſumed, That this Houſe may err, but if any Error be poſſible, 'tis impoſſible for the Judges to be relieved, for theſe Reaſons; in reſpect of the Court, for no Addreſs can be made in ſuch caſe, but to the ſame perſons who did the wrong; which is always with ſome prejudice or diſadvantage, becauſe the party Erring is to Judge, if he himſelf hath Erred. Then the Proceedings here being in Engliſh and Summary, it cannot well be made appear, what was the proof in the firſt inſtance, no Record being kept thereof. Then ſuppoſe Evidence be allowed, which is none, the perſon againſt whom the ſame is given, is remedileſs; theſe Evils may happen in the repeating of this practiſe in the next Reign, tho' they cannot in the preſent.</p>
            <p>Then this method is not only againſt the general tenor and frame of the Common-Law, but againſt divers Acts of Parliament and Declarations of this Houſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Magna Charta, 9 Hen.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 29. is expreſs, <hi>per judicium pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium vel per legem terre,</hi> now the latter only refers to ſuch caſes which are not Triable, <hi>per jud' par':</hi> beſides, to make it the <hi>lex ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re,</hi> there muſt be Ancient and continual uſage, 22 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. numb. 30. ſhews that no new practice can make a Law.</p>
            <p>By 25 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 4. 'tis Enacted, That no Man ſhall be taken by Petition or Suggeſtion to the King, or to his Counſel, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Preſentment, or by proceſs or Writ Original at Common-Law, and that none ſhall be put out of his Franchiſe or Freehold, but by due courſe of Law before uſed; here the one explains the other; by Writ or due courſe of Law are taken for the ſame thing, and both uſed in contradiſtinction to Petition; the 28 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 3. is the ſame.</p>
            <p>Then the 42 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 3. 'tis by due proceſs and Original Writ according to the Old Law of the Land; the 1 <hi>Rich.</hi> 2. numb. 87. <hi>Cott.</hi> 162. no Suit to be determined before the Lords or before the Counſel, but before the Juſtices only.</p>
            <p>But the 4 <hi>Hen.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 23. is fuller, it recites, That in Pleas as well real as perſonal in the King's Courts, the parties be made to come upon grievous pain, ſometimes before the King himſelf, ſometimes before the King's Council, ſometimes to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:50172:69"/>to anſwer thereof anew to the grievance of the Parties, and in Subverſion of the Common-Law of the Land, 'tis Enacted, that after Judgment, the Parties ſhall be in Peace until the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be undone by Attaint or Error; this is agreed and amplifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, 3 <hi>Bulſt.</hi> 47.115.</p>
            <p>Here is mention even of the Parliaments Summoning perſons to Anſwer, in Subverſion of the Laws.</p>
            <p>There are other Statutes not Printed, as 4 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. numb. 6. <hi>Cotton</hi>'s <hi>Abridg.</hi> 7. and the ſame in 2 <hi>Inſt.</hi> 50.</p>
            <p>The Lords gave Judgment of Death without Indictment, upon ſome who were not their Peers, and agreed in full Parliament, that they ſhould be diſcharged of ſo doing for the future, and that it ſhould not be drawn in Preſident, that the like ſhould not be done on any but their Peers; 'tis a Declaration of the Lords, nay, 'tis an Act of Parliament, and penned in the ſame manner, as 29 <hi>Edw.</hi> 1. Statute <hi>del Eſtoppel.</hi> at a Parliament agreed: 33 <hi>Edw.</hi> 1. by common accord, and 9 <hi>Edw.</hi> 2. the King in Parliament by Advice of his Council, and theſe are held to be Statutes.</p>
            <p>This was not only an acquittal from the trouble, but a clear de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial of the Power, as appears by the words before, that they had aſſumed upon themſelves, and the words ſubſequent, that the like ſhould not be done again. The Complaint was, becauſe it was intermedling with Commoners after that manner. Suppoſe this Houſe ſhould make an Order upon this matter, which is a Law buſineſs and not of Equity, no Execution can be made of it but Commitment.</p>
            <p>There is the 15 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. now inſiſted on, Printed in the Old Statute Book, but omitted in this; 'tis in <hi>Cotton,</hi> 28.33. and, 'tis thus, the Commons complained of breaches of <hi>Magna Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,</hi> &amp;c. and pray remedy, with this Concluſion, That every Man may ſtand to the Law according to his Condition, and the Lords pray, that <hi>Magna Charta</hi> may be obſerved, and further, that if any of what Condition ſoever, ſhould break it, he ſhould be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged by the Peers of the Realm in Parliament, the next Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſo from Parliament to Parliament, and it was Enacted accordingly. This was Specious, the ſame being only for the breakers of <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> but in 17 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. that whole Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>i. e.</hi> all the Acts of it are Repealed; which Repeal, ſeems deſigned for the Petitioners, for it Repeals the ſuppoſed Laws which make both their Title and this Juriſdiction which they would ſupport. 'Tis obſervable what is ſaid in the Repeal, that the Act was contrary to the King's Oath, in prejudice of his Crown and Royalty, and againſt the Ancient Law: And ſuch is this, for here's no uſe of the King's Writ, no Addreſs to or Command by the King for this Proceeding, nor any mention of his name in the Petition.</p>
            <p>By 1 <hi>Hen.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 14. Appeals in Parliament for Offences, are declared againſt, as contrary to Reaſon and the Conſtitution; this is ſuch. This is not incident to the Power of Hearing and Determining upon the Writ of Error, becauſe as was ſaid before,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:50172:70"/>it belongs properly to the Chancery, to Iſſue a Writ Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it to be done, <hi>Si ita eſt,</hi> as is Suggeſted.</p>
            <p>By 12 <hi>Rep.</hi> 63. the King himſelf cannot take any Cauſe out of the Court where it depends, and give Judgment on it him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
            <p>And this Houſe can make no Order upon this Petition that will be a Record, as in <hi>Hob.</hi> 110. The Petition is in the name of a Perſon, not party to the Record, which ſeems very new, for 'tis by a Stranger in the eye of the Law to the Cauſe, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ought not to be joyned in any legal proceeding, if this be ſuch.</p>
            <p>This is not incident to the Juriſdiction of the Error; no more than Amendment of an Error in the Court from whence the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord comes, or the filing of a Baile, a Declaration, or a War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of Attorney, or the Sueing out another Proceſs in Defect of one loſt or the like. Theſe things are never Examinable in the Superior Court, for in theſe Collateral things the other are intru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted.</p>
            <p>Here's no Hardſhip upon the Petitioner for he might have been Non-ſuite, or have given this Repeal'd Act in Evidence at firſt, and then have demurr'd on the Defendant's Evidence, or might have Sued a Writ on the Statute of <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> 2.</p>
            <p>But ſuppoſe this Houſe ſhould Examine this matter, and find the Petition to be groundleſs, will ſuch Determination prevent the Judges from being troubled by Sueing of the Writ after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. Suppoſe it <hi>E contra;</hi> that this Houſe ſhould puniſh the Judges and commit them, and award Damages, or make other Order in favour of the Petitioners, would ſuch Order bar or ſtop the legal proceſs afterwards; can any Order made here be uſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, as a Recovery or Acquittal, as an Auterfoits Convict, or Auterfoits Acquitte.</p>
            <p>If there be any thing in it, 'tis a breach of a Statute Law; for which they are puniſhable at the King's Suit; will the proceeding here ſave them from the trouble of anſwering to an Indictment or Information for the ſame thing.</p>
            <p>Then ſince a Writ lies to Command them to Seal this Bill, and ſince an Act of Parliament directs it, if it were a true one, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps it may be Queſtionable, if they do not break their Oaths, in caſe they Sign it in Obedience to any other direction. If they did it in Obedience to the Royal Word, Signet or Privy Seal, of the King their Maſter, 'twould be a breach of their Oath. Then as to preſidents of the Exerciſe of ſuch a Juriſdiction, none come near this: And abundance of particular Caſes were put and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered; but the conſiderable one was <hi>Jeffery Stanton</hi>'s Caſe, 14 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3.31. <hi>Cot.</hi> 30.</p>
            <p>The Caſe is odd, 'tis in <hi>Fitſ.</hi> Abridgment, <hi>tit voucher.</hi> 119. there is a Writ directory to the Judges to proceed to Judgment, or to bring the Record before the Parliament, that they might receive an Averment, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To this Caſe it was Anſwered, That the ſame was long before moſt of the Statutes aforementioned, and in full
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:50172:70"/>Parliament, and in that Caſe <hi>Stone</hi> would not agree to it, but ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hered to the Law according to his Opinion, 'tis true, <hi>Shard</hi> in the abſence of <hi>Stone,</hi> gave Judgment according to that Advice, but a Writ of Error was afterwards brought in the <hi>King</hi>'s-<hi>Bench,</hi> and the Judgment was Reverſed, 15 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. <hi>B. R.</hi> even con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Advice of Parliament, to the other Judges.</p>
            <p>As to the other Caſes of Property Examined here, either the Parties ſubmitted to Anſwer, or they were at the Suit or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint of the Commons, or by Conſent of the King and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, but none of them carry any reſemblance to this, where the Judges inſiſt upon it, that there is another and a proper Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy. All the Caſes in <hi>Ryley</hi>'s <hi>Placita Parliamentaria,</hi> are either Ordinances of Parliament, or directions to follow before the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices. But there's no Preſident to warrant this Petition, and therefore 'twas prayed, that the Petition might be Diſmiſſed... ..................... .....................</p>

                  <p>It was argued on behalf of the King, That there was no War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of Attorney filed, and conſequently the Reverſal was not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular; for default of an Appearance by the Heir, who proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Writ of Error; and that there was no Day given to the Attorney General; nor was the Attorney General, or the Paten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee, a Party to the Record, nor any Plea or Anſwer made by ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them to the Aſſignment of the Errors.</p>
                  <p>To this it was anſwered, That by the Common Practiſe in the <hi>Crown-Office,</hi> no Warrants of Attorney are filed, neither for De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendants upon Indictments, nor for Plaintiffs in the Writ of Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror; that it had not been known, within the Memory of any Man living, that ſuch Warrants were ever filed: That there need no day to be given to the King, or the Attorney General, for that the King's Attorney was ſuppoſed always preſent in Court, and the King cannot be Nonſuited, becauſe he cannot be called. That there never was any Anſwer to the Aſſignment of Errors in ſuch Caſes; That in Capital Caſes there needs no joyning of Iſſue up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on pleading <hi>Not Guilty.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then it was argued, That there was no Error to warrant the Reverſal to the Attainder; that the Exception taken to the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was trivial and frivolous; that <hi>ipſo vivente</hi> was not of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity to be inſerted; that never any Judge was known to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire that the Man's Bowels ſhould be burnt while he was alive; that the ſame was impoſſible to be executed; that the Law never appointed any Judgment for Treaſon, as eſſential, beſides Draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Hanging; and that Quartering has been ſo long uſed, as to be accounted part of the Judgment, yet 'tis not neceſſary to make a good Judgment; and if that be ſo, no more is needful than Drawing, Hanging, and Quartering; that Ancient Preſidents were thus ſhort; <hi>Rot' Parliament'</hi> 3 <hi>Hen.</hi> 5. <hi>p.</hi> 1. <hi>n.</hi> 6. <hi>Thomas de Gray &amp; al'</hi> had been Attainted of Treaſon upon a Special Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion at <hi>Southampton,</hi> and the Record of the Attainder removed into Parliament, 3 <hi>Hen.</hi> 5. and the Judgment was good, <hi>Thomas de Gray ut proditor Domini Regis &amp; Regni ſui</hi> Angliae, <hi>diſtrahatur ſuſpendatur &amp; decapitetur:</hi> And in the Records, <hi>Penes Theſ. &amp; Camar' Scacc'</hi> 3 Hen. 7. f. 10. a.

And Mr. <hi>John Hampden</hi> had the like Judgment as <hi>Burnett,</hi> &amp;c. 1 <hi>Jac.</hi> 2. upon confeſſing an Indictment of the ſame kind with <hi>Walcott</hi>'s. Whereupon, conſidering that many Preſidents were without this, and that the Eſſential Parts of the Puniſhment were in this Judgment, 'twas prayed that the Judgment of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal might be Reverſed, and the Attainder confirmed.</p>
                  <p>On the other ſide it was argued, That the Original Judgment was Erroneous, and the Reverſal juſt. And firſt it was obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, That this Writ of Error was new and particular, <hi>ex gravi querela</hi> of the Counteſs of <hi>Roſcommon,</hi> who had nothing to do with the Record, was a meer ſtranger to it, and yet 'tis ſuggeſted that the Reverſal was to her Damage.</p>
                  <p>Then 'twas urged that there was an Error in the firſt Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for that the Judgment, in Caſe of Treaſon, is by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law, and that it is and muſt be certain, and not at the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the Court which pronounces and gives it: That it ought to be ſevere, becauſe 'tis a Puniſhment for the greateſt Offence which can be committed, <hi>Crimen leſe Majeſtatis,</hi> a Sin of the firſt Magnitude, an Offence which imports Treachery to the Prince, Enmity to the Country, Defiance to all Government, a Deſign to overthrow and confound all Order and Property, and even the Community it ſelf; and in its Conſequence occaſions the Practiſe of all other Crimes whatſoever, as Murders, Burglaries, Robbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, &amp;c. and therefore our Conſtitution hath impoſed upon it a ſevere and cruel Judgment, ſuch as the <hi>Engliſh</hi> do allow or permit in no other Caſe; the greateſt of other Crimes incur Death only; but for Treaſon the Judgment is different. Sir <hi>Tho. Smith</hi>'s Treatiſe <hi>de Republica Anglic.</hi> 198. there ought in reaſon to be a proportion between the Offence and the Puniſhment; and as this is the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, ſo the Penalty is <hi>morte multo atrocior;</hi> and in <hi>Fleta lib.</hi> 1. <hi>p.</hi> 21.

Several Books do in ſhort put it, That for Treaſon the Party ſhall be Drawn and Hanged and Quartered, but thoſe are only Hints of the Chief Parts, not Recitals of the Judgment it ſelf. In the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Book of <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> printed 1655. <hi>pag.</hi> 292. 'tis mentioned particularly as the <hi>Kings Bench</hi> have adjudged it ſhould be.

In the Lord <hi>Stafford</hi>'s Caſe, 33 <hi>Car.</hi> 2. by the Direction of this Houſe, and with the Advice of all the Judges, was the Judgment ſo given by the Earl of <hi>Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingham</hi> then Lord High Steward. In the Lord <hi>Preſton</hi>'s Caſe 'tis ſo, which was drawn by Advice of the then Attorney and Sollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, the preſent Keeper and Chief Juſtice of the <hi>Common Pleas.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As to the Objection, That <hi>vivens proſternatur</hi> doth imply it, and that's enough. It was anſwered, That <hi>ipſo vivente comburen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur</hi> implies both, but not <hi>e contra;</hi> and all the Preſidents ſhew the latter to be requiſite. And as to the Caſe of <hi>David</hi> Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> mentioned in <hi>Fleta,</hi> there's only a Relation of what was the Execution, not of what was the Judgment. And <hi>Coke</hi> 2 <hi>Inſt.</hi> 195. ſays, That the Judgment was in Parliament, and therefore the ſame can be no Preſident to this purpoſe; and any one that runs over <hi>Cotton</hi>'s Records, will find the Judgments in Parliament to be different, as the Nature of the Caſe required. No Argument can be drawn from the Acts of the Legiſlature to govern Judiciary Proceedings; however, <hi>John Hall</hi>'s Caſe 1 <hi>Hen.</hi> 4. <hi>Cott.</hi> 401. is as now contended for. Before the 1 <hi>Hen.</hi> 7. there were ſome Erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous Attainders; and the 29 <hi>Eliz.</hi> takes notice of them as ſo er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rneous. The Judgments againſt <hi>Benſon</hi> and Sir <hi>Andrew Helſey</hi> (cited below) are plainly erroneous; they diſpoſe of the Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, which they ought not, but leave the ſame to the King's plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. Sir <hi>Andrew</hi>'s Preſident is a monſtrous arbitrary Command by Writ to Commiſſioners of <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Terminer,</hi> ordering them
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:50172:75"/>to Examine him, and to give Judgment in manner as in the Writ is directed, that therefore is not to be juſtified; and 'twas before 25 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. <hi>Henry Ropers</hi> 21 <hi>Rich.</hi> 2. doth diſpoſe of the Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and hath other Errors in it; and ſo have <hi>William Bathurst</hi>'s and <hi>Henry South</hi>'s, which were in 3 <hi>Hen.</hi> 4. But from that time to 26 <hi>Car.</hi> 2. there's none which do omit it. The four Preſidents at the <hi>Old Baily</hi> were againſt Popiſh Prieſts, and what private poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Reaſons or Commands might occaſion the omiſſion, is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known; and <hi>Hampden</hi> was not Executed, but his Judgment was upon a Confeſſion, and his Life ſaved, the reaſon of which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo unknown: So that there have been none Executed upon ſuch Erroneous Judgments: And that there are no more Preſidents, with the Omiſſion, is a good Argument, that thoſe many which have this Particular in them, are good and legal; the conſtant Current having been this way, proves the ſame to be the Common Law. And this is the moſt ſevere part of the Puniſhment, to have his Bowels cut out while alive, and therefore not to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted. As to the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi>'s Caſe in <hi>Moore,</hi> and <hi>Owen</hi>'s Caſe in <hi>Roll</hi>'s <hi>Rep.</hi> the firſt is only a Report of the Caſe, and the laſt a deſcant upon the Judgment, but neither do pretend to recite the whole Judgment.</p>
                  <p>Then, to pretend that this Judgment cannot be Executed, is to arraign the Wiſdom and Knowledge of all the Judges and Kings Counſel in all Reigns: And Tradition ſaith that <hi>Harriſon,</hi> one of the Regicides, did mount himſelf, and give the Executioner a Box on the Ear after his Body was opened, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Then 'twas argued, That if it be a neceſſary part of the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and be omitted, it is a fatal Error, and doth undoubtedly in all Caſes give a good reaſon for the Reverſal of ſuch Judgment, as in the Common Caſe of Debt, where <hi>dampna</hi> are omitted in the Judgment, tho' for the Advantage of the Defendant, as is <hi>Bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher</hi>'s Caſe, and <hi>Yelv.</hi> 107. Beſides, if this be legal, then all thoſe Attainders, in which this Particular is inſerted, muſt be illegal; for 'tis impoſſible that both the Judgments ſhould be right; for either thoſe are more ſevere than they ſhould be, or this is more remiſs. To ſay, that 'tis diſcretionary, is to give the Judges a power, which they themſelves have diſclaimed; and to Reverſe this Reverſal, is to tell the Court of <hi>Kings Bench,</hi> that they are not obliged to follow the General Practiſe of their Predeceſſors; that they are obliged to no form in their Judgment for Treaſon; that nothing but Death, and being Drawn to it, are eſſential; and according to that Doctrine, a Woman might receive the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Quartering, and a Man might be Burnt, and both accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Law. But the Conſtitution of this Kingdom hath preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed and fixed Rules and Forms, which the Executive Power is obliged and bound to follow; that as nothing can be made or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrued to be an Offence at the Pleaſure of the Court, ſo no Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment can be given for any known Offence at Pleaſure. But the Law, either Statute or Common, hath eſtabliſhed what is an Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:50172:75"/>and what is its Puniſhment; and there is nothing of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary Power allowed in reſpect of either. Wherefore upon the whole it was prayed, that the Reverſal might be affirmed, and it was affirmed accordingly.</p>

            <p>APpeal from a Decree of Diſmiſſion in <hi>Chancery.</hi> The Caſe was thus: <hi>Rice Tannott</hi> died ſeized in Fee of ſeveral Lands in the ſeveral Counties of <hi>Salop, Denbigh,</hi> and <hi>Montgomery,</hi> lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving three Daughters and Coheirs, <hi>Mary, Penelope,</hi> and <hi>Suſan. Suſan</hi> married <hi>Sidney Godolphin,</hi> one of the preſent Appellants. In <hi>July</hi> 1674. <hi>Mary</hi> and <hi>Penelope,</hi> in conſideration of 4000 <hi>l.</hi> paid to the ſaid <hi>Mary</hi> by <hi>Richard Carew</hi> Eſq; and in conſideration of a Marriage to be had, and which was afterwards had, between <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelope</hi> and the ſaid <hi>Richard Carew,</hi> by Leaſe and Releaſe, convey all thoſe their two Parts of the ſaid Lands in <hi>Denbigh, Salop,</hi> and <hi>Montgomery,</hi> to Truſtees and their Heirs, to the uſe of <hi>Richard Carew</hi> for Life, then to <hi>Penelope</hi> for Life for her Jointure, then to the ſaid Truſtees and their Heirs, during the Lives of <hi>Richard</hi> and <hi>Penelope,</hi> to preſerve contingent Remainders; then to the firſt and other Sons of <hi>Richard</hi> and <hi>Penelope</hi> in Tail-Male ſucceſſively: And in default of Iſſue-Male, to the Daughters of <hi>Richard</hi> and <hi>Penelope</hi> in Tail: And in default of ſuch Iſſue, as to one Moiety of the ſaid two Parts to the firſt and other Sons of the ſaid <hi>Pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lope</hi> by any other Husband in Tail, the Remainder of all and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular the Premiſſes to the ſaid <hi>Richard Carew</hi> and his Heirs for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, ſubject to this Proviſo, <hi>That if it ſhould happen that no Iſſue of the ſaid</hi> Richard, <hi>upon the Body of the ſaid</hi> Penelope, <hi>ſhould be living at the deceaſe of the Survivor of them, and the Heirs of the ſaid</hi> Penelope <hi>ſhould within Twelve Months after the deceaſe of the Survivor of the ſaid</hi> Richard <hi>and</hi> Penelope <hi>dying without Iſſue as aforeſaid, pay to the Heirs or Aſſigns of the ſaid</hi> Richard Carew <hi>the Sum of</hi> 4000 <hi>l. that then the Remainder in Fee-ſimple ſo limited, to the ſaid</hi> Richard Carew <hi>and his Heirs ſhould ceaſe; and that then, and from thenceforth, the Premiſſes ſhould remain to the uſe of the right Heirs of the ſaid</hi> Penelope <hi>for ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this <hi>Mary</hi> intermarried with the Appellant Sir <hi>Evan Lloyd,</hi> and a Partition was made of the Premiſſes, and the ſame had been enjoyed accordingly ever ſince, and Mr. <hi>Carew</hi> and his Lady levi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Fine to Mr. <hi>Godolphin</hi> and his Lady of his part; who did
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:50172:76"/>thereupon by their Deed dated 23 <hi>Sept.</hi> 1676. covenant to levy a Fine of Mr. <hi>Carew</hi>'s two Parts, to ſuch uſes as he and his Lady ſhould limit and appoint, but have not yet levied the ſaid Fine.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Richard Carew</hi> and <hi>Penelope</hi> his Wife, to avoid all Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies that might happen, whereby the Eſtate of the ſaid <hi>Richard Carew,</hi> or his Heirs, might be queſtion'd or incumbred by the Heirs of <hi>Penelope;</hi> and to the End to extinguiſh and deſtroy and barr all ſuch Eſtate, Right, Title, Equitable or other Intereſt, as the ſaid <hi>Penelope</hi> then had, or her Iſſue and Heirs might have or claim to the ſame, by any Power, Settlement, or Condition, on pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of 4000 <hi>l.</hi> or otherwiſe, to the Heirs of <hi>Richard Carew,</hi> by the Heirs of the ſaid <hi>Penelope;</hi> and for the ſettling of the ſame on the ſaid <hi>Richard Carew</hi> and his Heirs, did in <hi>Michaelmas</hi> Term 1681. levy a Fine of the Share and Part allotted to them, and by Deed of 10 <hi>Decemb.</hi> 1681. declare that the ſaid Fine ſhould be to the uſe of the ſaid <hi>Richard</hi> for Life, Remainder to <hi>Penelope</hi> for Life, the Remainder to the ſaid <hi>Richard Carew</hi> his Heirs and Aſſigns for ever: And do further declare, That the Fine agreed to be levied by the Appellants <hi>Sidney Godolphin</hi> and <hi>Suſan</hi> his Wife, by their Deed dated the 23 <hi>Sept.</hi> 1676. ſhould be to the ſame uſes, and then direct the Truſtees by the firſt Settlement to convey to thoſe uſes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Penelope</hi> died without Iſſue in 1690. <hi>Richard Carew</hi> made his Will in <hi>Aug.</hi> 1691. and deviſed the ſaid Lands to Sir <hi>John Carew</hi> Baronet, his Brother, ſubject to pay all his Debts and Legacies, and made Sir <hi>John Carew</hi> his Executor.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Decemb.</hi> 1691. <hi>Richard Carew</hi> died without Iſſue, and Sir <hi>John Carew</hi> entred, and was ſeized and poſſeſſed of the Premiſſes, and paid 4855 <hi>l.</hi> for the Debts of <hi>Richard Carew.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sir <hi>John Carew</hi> died, and the Reſpondent, Sir <hi>Richard Carew</hi> an Infant, is his Son, Heir, and Executor.</p>
            <p>The Appellants, <hi>Mary</hi> and <hi>Suſan,</hi> claiming the Lands as Heirs to <hi>Penelope,</hi> by virtue of the ſaid Proviſo in the firſt Settlement, upon payment of the 4000 <hi>l.</hi> exhibited their Bill in <hi>Chancery</hi> to compel the Truſtees to convey the Eſtate to them upon ſuch pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>Upon hearing of this Cauſe on Bill and Anſwer, the Court ordered a State of the Caſe to be drawn, which was as above; and afterwards the Court, aſſiſted by the Chief Juſtice of the <hi>Common Pleas,</hi> and Mr. Juſtice <hi>Rooksby,</hi> ſeeing no Cauſe to relieve the Plaintiffs diſmiſſed their Bill.</p>
            <p>And now it was argued on behalf of the Appellants, That ſuch Diſmiſſion ought to be ſet aſide; and amongſt other things, it was inſiſted on in favour of the Appeal, that this Proviſo was not void; that it was within the reaſon of the Contingent Limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations allowed by the late Lord Chancellor <hi>Nottingham</hi> in the Caſe of the Duke of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> and there were quoted ſeveral Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragraphs in the Argument made by the ſaid Lord Chancellor, as
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:50172:76"/>that future Intereſts, ſpringing Truſts; or Truſts Executory, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainders that are to emerge or ariſe upon Contingency, are quite out of the Rules and Reaſons of Perpetuities; nay, out of the Reaſon, upon which the Policy of the Law is founded in thoſe Caſes, eſpecially if they be not of remote or long Conſideration, but ſuch as by a natural and eaſie Interpretation will ſpeedily wear out, and ſo things come to the right Channel again: That tho' there can be no Remainders limited after a Fee-ſimple, yet there may be a Contingent Fee-ſimple ariſe out of the firſt Fee; that the <hi>ultimum quod ſit,</hi> or the utmoſt Limitation of a Fee upon a Fee is not yet plainly determined; that tho' it be impoſſible to limit a Remainder of a Fee upon a Fee, yet 'tis not impoſſible to limit a Contingent Fee upon a Fee; that no Conveyance is ever to be ſet aſide in <hi>Chancery,</hi> where it can be ſupported by a reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Conſtruction, eſpecially where 'tis a Family Settlement. Then theſe Paragraphs were applied; and further urged, That there could not in reaſon be any difference between a Contingency to happen during Life or Lives, or within one year afterwards; that the true reaſon of ſuch Opinions which allowed them, if happening within the time of the Parties lives, or upon their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſes, was becauſe no Inconvenience could be apprehended there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by; and the ſame Reaſon will hold to one year afterwards; and the true Rule is to fix Limits and Boundaries to ſuch Limitations, when ſo made, as that they prove Inconvenient, and not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe: That this Limitation upon this Contingency happening, was the conſiderate Intention of the Family, the Circumſtances whereof required Conſideration, and this Settlement was the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult of it, and made by good Advice: That the Fine could not barr the Benefit of this Proviſo; for that the ſame never was, nor ever could be in <hi>Penelope,</hi> who levied the Fine.</p>
            <p>As to the Pretence, That if the Appellants were relieved, <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard Carew</hi> who married <hi>Penelope,</hi> would have no Portion with her. 'Twas anſwered, That that could not alter the Caſe; the Agreement and Intention of the Parties being the moſt conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Matter; and beſides, <hi>Richard</hi> enjoyed the Eſtate during his Life without impeachment of Waſte. And as to the Debts, 'twas anſwered, That thoſe were no Ingredients in the Queſtion; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever there would be 4000 <hi>l.</hi> paid towards it, and the Perſonal Eſtate was more than enough to pay the reſidue. For which, and other Reaſons, 'twas prayed that the Diſmiſſion might be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed.</p>
            <p>On the other ſide it was inſiſted on with the Decree, 1. That the Limitation by the Settlement in <hi>July</hi> 1674. to the Heirs of <hi>Penelope,</hi> upon payment of 4000 <hi>l.</hi> by them to the Heirs of <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard Carew,</hi> within Twelve Months after the death of <hi>Richard</hi> and <hi>Penelope,</hi> without Iſſue, at the time of the deceaſe of the Survivor of them, is a void Limitation, the Fee-ſimple being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore limited to <hi>Richard</hi> and his Heirs, and ſo not capable of a
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:50172:77"/>further Limitation, unleſs upon a Contingency to happen in the Life of one or more Perſons in being, at the time of the Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; which is the furtheſt that the Judges have ever yet gone, in allowing theſe Contingent Limitations upon a Fee; and which were the Bounds ſet to theſe Limitations by the late Lord Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor <hi>Nottingham,</hi> in the Caſe of the Duke of <hi>Norfolk;</hi> that tho' there were ſuch Expreſſions as had been read on the other ſide, yet the Bounds ſet by him to theſe Limitations, were only depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent upon Life or Lives in being, and never as yet went any further: And if they ſhould be Extended, and allowed to be good upon Contingencies to happen within Twelve Months af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Death of one or more Perſons, they may be as well allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon Contingencies to happen within a Thouſand years; by which all the Miſchiefs, that are the neceſſary Conſequents of Perpetuities, which have been ſo induſtriouſly avoided in all Ages, will be let in; and the Owner of a Fee-ſimple thus clogged, would be no more capable of providing for the Neceſſities and Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents of his Family, then a bare Tenant for Life.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If this Limitation were good, 'twas urged, That the Eſtate limited to the Heirs of <hi>Penelope</hi> was virtually in her, and her Heirs muſt claim by Deſcent from her, and not as Purchaſors; and by Conſequence this Eſtate is effectually barred by the Fine of <hi>Pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lope:</hi> the deſign of limiting this Power to the Heirs, not being to exclude the Anceſtor; but becauſe the Power could not in its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture be executed until after the deceaſe of the Anceſtor, it being to take effect upon a Contingency, that could not happen till af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that time; and this Bill and Appeal was not only to have the ſaid <hi>Richard Carew,</hi> who married <hi>Penelope,</hi> to have not one Farthing Portion with his Wife, but to make the now Reſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Sir <hi>Richard Carew,</hi> to loſe the 4855 <hi>l.</hi> which his Father Sir <hi>John Carew</hi> paid, as charged on the Lands in queſtion. For which Reaſons, and many others well urged about the Miſchief and Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of Perpetuities, and their Increaſe of late years, to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangling and ruine of many Families, it was prayed that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of Diſmiſſion might be affirmed, but the ſame was Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed.</p>

            <p>Afterwards the Fine was levied, <hi>Octabis Purificationis,</hi> which was the 9th of <hi>February</hi> in that Term: And afterwards by Inden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture between the ſaid <hi>Edward Morley</hi> of the one part, and one <hi>Henry Doble</hi> of the other part, dated 9 <hi>July</hi> 1666. the ſaid <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> in conſideration of 600 <hi>l.</hi> Mortgages the ſaid Mannor to <hi>Doble</hi> and his Heirs: Then the Money not being paid by <hi>Edward Morley</hi> to <hi>Doble, Doble</hi> did 2 <hi>June</hi> 1676. in conſideration of 600 <hi>l.</hi> with Intereſt, paid by Sir <hi>William Morley,</hi> conveys the ſaid Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor to one <hi>Thomas Young;</hi> that <hi>Edward Morley</hi> did never convey
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:50172:78"/>the Lands agreed to be conveyed for a Joynture to the value of 300 <hi>l. per Annum,</hi> but did ſettle and convey only part, which was of the value of 250 <hi>l. per Annum,</hi> and no more, and that ſubject and liable to the payment of 15 <hi>l.</hi> yearly for ever to a Stranger. The ſaid <hi>Anne</hi> dies without Iſſue, and <hi>Henry Bellingham</hi> was Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin and next Heir, <hi>Et ſi,</hi> &amp;c. And Judgment was given in <hi>B. R. pro quer'.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was argued on the behalf of Sir <hi>William Morley,</hi> That this Judgment was Erroneous; that the firſt Deed, and the Matter of the Joynture was nothing in the Caſe; that the Queſtion was, to what uſes the Fine was levied; that the Deed executed under Seal between <hi>Edward</hi> and <hi>Anne,</hi> and the Truſtees, did effectually de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the uſes of this Fine, and that the ſecond Inſtrument cannot be made uſe of, as a Deed, to controul the former; that the firſt was fairly made, and all Parties requiſite concurring to it. And that of the 31 <hi>Jan.</hi> was not a Deed; for a Man cannot make a Deed to his Wife, or to himſelf; this cannot be conſtrued a Deed-Poll, when 'tis Indented; for that is to conſtrue a thing different from what it is: Intent may be conſtrued, but one Thing or ſort of Inſtrument can never be taken for another. Then ſuppoſing it a Deed-Poll, it doth not revoke, it takes no notice of the Fine or the Deed; it hath no reference to either of them; it ſays that all Agreements are to be void; but how? 'tis not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely; only till a particular Thing be done: So that 'tis not a Revocation, ſo as to annul the Deed of the 29th: and the Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band by this neither did, nor could direct the uſe of the Fine to be to the Wife. Suppoſe that before the Statute of Uſes, a Man had declared an Uſe to his Wife, it was no Truſt or Uſe, for that no <hi>Subpena</hi> lay at the Inſtance of the Wife againſt the Husband. A Man could not be a Truſtee for his Wife. Now no Uſe can be Executed by the Statute, but where a <hi>Subpena</hi> did lye before the Statute to compel the Injoyment according to it: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore 'tis, that a Corporation could not be ſeized to an Uſe, becauſe no <hi>Subpena;</hi> and no <hi>Subpena,</hi> becauſe no Attachment lay againſt a Body Corporate. Suppoſe the laſt Deed to be any thing, 'tis only a Parol Evidence, and that will not Revoke the firſt Deed.</p>
            <p>Then here's no Variance between the Fine and the Deed of the 29th: The Deed ſays a Fine is already acknowledg'd, and to be levied the next <hi>Hillary</hi> Term, between the ſame Parties, and of the ſame Lands: This is either the next <hi>Hillary</hi> Term after the Conu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance of the Fine, or after the Deed: Then 'tis not uſual to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge a Fine, and levy it an Year after; 'tis not allowable in Practiſe, and therefore 'tis not to be ſo Expounded; for Men are to be intended to act reaſonably, and according to Common Uſage. Now 'tis true, it doth not appear when the Caption was, whether in or before the Term; yet common Intendment muſt carry it, that the Caption was before the Term, and ſo 'twas to be a Fine of that Term, or to be in or before the next <hi>Hillary;</hi> the Parties deſigned not, the Fine ſhould lye for one whole Year:
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:50172:78"/>If it had been in or before, it had been well enough; then, tho' thoſe words are not in, it is plain that the Intent was ſo: The Earl of <hi>Rutland</hi>'s Caſe, was upon Evidence, and not upon Pleading. If levied before the time, that is well; the next <hi>Hillary</hi> Term, is no more, then on or before; or in <hi>Hillary</hi> next at the furtheſt, or by <hi>Hillary</hi> Term next: Theſe all do ſound much to the ſame purpoſe in common Underſtanding. The End of a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction is to ſupply the Defects of Expreſſion; Then taking it for the next <hi>Hillary</hi> Term after that Term. If I do a thing before the time, 'tis done in purſuance of the Intent; for the Day given is for the Advantage of the Party who hath Liberty given to forbear the Act during all that ſpace, till the laſt Day of the time given; but if he doth it ſooner, the End is fulfilled; ſo Payment before is always reckoned as Payment at the Day: And 'tis ſo in all Caſes, where the Time is not in the moſt conſiderable part of the Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as in Harveſt, in Winter, or the like; and the Nature of the Act is ſuch, that 'tis moſt convenient for the Obligee or Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venantee to have it at that Seaſon, and not before: In the Earl of <hi>Rutland</hi>'s Caſe, 'tis agreed if within the time, 'tis good. Will any Man ſay that this is not the Fine which was meant? If a Covenant be to make a Feoffment in <hi>Trinity</hi> Term next, ſuch a Feoffment be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore fulfils the Covenant: This is not a Fine acknowledg'd by any other Parties, of any other Lands, or upon any other Agreement. Suppoſe a Man had a power of Revocation by Deed under Seal with Witneſſes, and had covenanted in ſuch manner to levy a Fine before this Day Twelve-month, and before the Day he had levied a Fine; now the Deed was no Revocation, becauſe not Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs, and of it ſelf made no Alteration in the Eſtate; and the Fine of it ſelf was not, becauſe not by Deed atteſted; but both together make a Revocation; they are but one Conveyance, as was adjudged in the two Caſes of <hi>Wigſon</hi> and <hi>Garret,</hi> and <hi>Herring</hi> and <hi>Brown;</hi> Should not this have been a Revocation? Either this firſt was deſigned to deceive the Wife, or the ſecond was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to deceive Creditors and Mortgagees; the Creditor is to be preferred. Suppoſe the firſt were made, as 'tis moſt likely to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able him to borrow Money. 'twould be hard to conſtrue the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond good: Would any Purchaſor have doubted this Title, if he had ſeen the Fine and this Deed of the 29th? To allow this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, is to Countenance a Practiſe which may deceive any Man; for a Deed precedent leading the Uſes of a Fine, is binding, and concludes againſt any Thing but an intermediate Deed between that and the Fine; and ſuch private Agreement between Husband and Wife, may be had and pretended in any Caſe whatſoever. Then was cited <hi>Havergill</hi> and <hi>Hare,</hi> 2 <hi>Rolls</hi> 799. And 'twas fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſaid, that againſt a Mortgagee the ſecond will be void, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Proger</hi>'s Caſe, 1 <hi>Sid.</hi> 133. A Conveyance voluntary, that was good in its firſt Creation, may become void by ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Accidents; and in truth it was admitted below, that this ſecond Writing was no Deed, had no more efficacy than a Parol
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:50172:79"/>Averment; and conſequently the only Query can be, If this Fine be another, and different, from that which was meant and intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Deed of the 29th: for if it be not, then Parol Averments or Agreements ought not to be admitted. Beſides, this is but Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, nor proper for the Court to conſider, and the Jury ſhould have concluded ſpecially, That if Parol Evidence, or a naked A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verment ſhould be admitted, then they find to ſuch Uſes: But here 'tis like finding the Badges of Fraud, without finding the Fraud it ſelf, or a Demand and Denial, without finding a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion; upon neither of which can the Court judge the Thing to be a Fraud or a Converſion. And for theſe and other like Reaſons it was prayed, that the Judgment might be reverſed.</p>
            <p>It was argued on the other ſide with the Judgment, That this Fine thus levied was not to the uſe of the Husband, but of the Wife and her Heirs; that the Fine is not to the Uſes in the Deed of the 29th, but controuled by that of the 31ſt. 'Twas agreed, that if there be a Deed to levy a Fine, and in purſuance thereof a Fine is levied, to the Perſon, of the Lands, and at the time, no Proof ſhall be allowed, that the Fine was to any other Uſe, but if it be in caſe of a ſubſequent Deed, then Averment may be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it; but by the making of a precedent Deed, all Parties are eſtopped to contradict it, unleſs there be another Deed of equal Nature to controul that. Where the Deed is punctually obſerved, there's no liberty to aver the contrary; but where 'tis not purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the Averment is conſiſtent. Where it doth vary, yet if no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing doth appear to the contrary, there the fine ſhall be conſtrued to be to the Uſes of the Deed by conſtruction of Law; a Wife is bound by the Husband's Declaration; and if the Fine be in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuance of the Husband's Deed, 'tis as binding to her, as if ſhe were a Party: An Infant cannot avoid a Fine, where there was a Deed agreeable, but by reverſing it.</p>
            <p>Then 'twas argued, That here was ſuch a Variance as did allow of ſuch Averment; that 'tis true, the Deed of 29. had been a good Declaration of the Uſes of this Fine, notwithſtanding the Variance, if the Writing of 31. had not been made; but there being a Variance, that is admiſſible; that this Fine now found differs as much from that in the Deed, as if it had been levied at a time after; that levying it before, makes it not the ſame. The Woman perhaps here did agree to levy a Fine at this diſtance of time, that ſhe might in the mean while have a competent Proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on out of her Husband's Eſtate for her Joynture, then when ſhe levies this Fine at a different time, ſhe doth not do it in purſuance of the firſt Deed. Then 1 <hi>Rep.</hi> 76, 99. 3 <hi>Bulſtr.</hi> 231. 2 <hi>Rolls A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridg.</hi> 251. 2 <hi>Cro.</hi> 646. 2 <hi>Rolls Abridg.</hi> 799. <hi>Savil</hi> 124. 1 <hi>Leon.</hi> 210. 3 <hi>Cro.</hi> 210. 1 <hi>And.</hi> 240. were quoted, and either anſwered or applied to this Point of Variance.</p>
            <p>Then 'twas ſaid, That there was a difference between a Fine that varies from a precedent Deed, and a Fine that is followed with a ſubſequent Deed or Declaration of Uſes. If there be a
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:50172:79"/>ſubſequent Declaration, the Heir at Law cannot aver that 'twas to the uſe of the Conuſor and his Heirs, or to any other uſe then what is in the Deed; the Party himſelf, or his Heirs cannot aver it, but they are eſtopped by this Deed, tho' ſubſequent; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, a Stranger is at liberty to make ſuch Averment: But if a Deed be precedent, and the Fine varies, and is not the ſame, there none are eſtopped, neither the Party himſelf, his Heir, nor a Stranger; becauſe the Fine ſtands alone, without any Deed referring to it, and declaring the uſes of it.</p>
            <p>'Then 'twas urged, That this ſecond Deed was ſufficient to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the uſes of this Fine: If the uſe ariſe upon, or by tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutation of the Poſſeſſion, as by Fine or Feoffment, 'tis ſufficient without any Deed; the uſe ariſes only upon the Parties Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Appointment: If without a tranſmutation of Poſſeſſion, there muſt be ſome Agreement binding the Party upon ſome Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration; for the uſe being founded in Equity, the <hi>Chancery</hi> would never relieve, where there was no tranſmutation of Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion or Agreement upon Conſideration; and if in Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Blood, it muſt be by Deed, becauſe the Conſideration is not binding without it, <hi>Moore</hi>'s <hi>Rep. Callow</hi> and <hi>Callow.</hi> If this Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of 31. had expreſly declared, that it ſhould enure to the Husband and his Heirs upon ſuch a Contingency, this had been a good ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Declaration of the uſe, and would have altered the Eſtate, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the tranſmutation of the Poſſeſſion; and as 'tis now penned, 'tis a good Writing, ſufficient to declare the uſes of the Fine; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſort of Agreement, whereby the Parties intent appears, is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient; an uſe is an equitable thing; and if it appears to have been intended, that is enough, 2 <hi>Leon.</hi> 14. <hi>Brent</hi>'s Caſe: any A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement between the Party that hath the Eſtate, and him who is to have it, may raiſe an uſe in this Caſe: a Bargain and Sale of the Lands carries the uſe, tho' no mention of it: 8 <hi>Rep. Fox</hi>'s Caſe, <hi>Croſſing</hi> and <hi>Scudamore;</hi> In this Caſe there was an Agreement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Husband and Wife, that he ſhould have the Lands, if he made a Jointure. A Bargain and Sale, tho' not inrolled, a Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Feoffment without Livery, ſhall raiſe the uſe of a Fine le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vied between the ſame Parties; therefore this Writing is a good Appointment. But ſuppoſe it were not ſo of it ſelf, 'tis ſufficient to controul that of the 29th; for 'tis agreed thereby, that all Deeds ſhall be revoked; which ſhews plainly, that the Fine was not to be to the uſes mentioned in that Deed, eſpecially when it varies from it. A Parol Declaration of the Mind of the Party will be enough to controul and hinder the raiſing of an uſe by the Deed, and Fine where different; and if ſo, then the uſe here is to the Wife and her Heirs. Then ſuppoſing the Variance frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and immaterial, this Writing of the Husband and Wife is a good appointment; the Truſtees or Conuſees of the Fine need not to be Parties to the appointing or declaring of the uſes: The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denture precedent is but directory, and if there be another directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on under Seal before the Fine, it muſt over-rule the firſt, Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:50172:80"/>of it ſelf ſeems enough, 2 <hi>Cro.</hi> 29. 3 <hi>Cro.</hi> 571. But ſuppoſe an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorſment on the Indenture revoking one uſe, before the Fine be le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vied, would not that controul it? This is rather like a laſt Will, and the laſt before the Fine muſt ſtand. A Covenant to ſtand ſeized muſt have all the neceſſary Parts of a Deed, ſo as to have been obligatory in <hi>Chancery</hi> before the Statute; but a meer Declaration of uſes need not be ſo formal: The uſe declared by the 29th was always revocable till the Fine was levied: and this is ſufficient both to revoke the laſt Declaration, and to declare new uſes; this amounts at leaſt to a Deed-Poll, and therefore ſufficient. Then were cited <hi>Moore</hi> 22, 512. <hi>Latch.</hi> 139. and many other Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: And upon the whole 'twas prayed, that the Judgment ſhould be affirmed; and it was affirmed.</p>

<pb n="147" facs="tcp:50172:80"/>in writing 1645. was a Revocation in Law of the ſaid Deviſe of the ſaid Lands to Mrs. <hi>Berkley,</hi> they are ignorant, and pray the Judgment of the Court, <hi>Et ſi,</hi> And upon this Judgment was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for the Plaintiff in the Ejectment.</p>
            <p>And now it was argued, That the Judgment was Erroneous; that this laſt Will could not be taken to be a duplicate of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, but muſt be deemed a Revocation; that no Will is good but the laſt; that every Will is revokable till death; that the making of another, doth import a Revocation of all former ones, tho' it be not ſo expreſly declared in writing; for it muſt be the laſt, or nothing; that this Conveyance by Will was anciently a Priviledge by the Civil Law, for People <hi>in Extremis,</hi> who had not the time or aſſiſtance neceſſary to make a formal Alienation, and chiefly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for Military Men, who were always ſuppoſed to be under thoſe Circumſtances, and therefore the Ceremonies and number of Witneſſes required of others, were diſpenſed with, as to Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers; but now the Rules for Military Teſtaments, as they are called, are allowed in moſt Caſes; that as to Lands, by our Law, was a Priviledge only given to ſome Boroughs and Places within the Kingdom; and particular Cuſtom gave the liberty of diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Lands or Houſes by Will, and that by nuncupative Will or Parol without writing; ſo is <hi>Bracton. lib.</hi> 4. <hi>fol.</hi> 272. <hi>Fleta lib.</hi> 5. <hi>cap.</hi> 5. <hi>Poteſt legari &amp; catallum tam hereditas quam perquiſitum per Barones</hi> London <hi>&amp; Burgenſes</hi> Oxon, 1 <hi>Inſt.</hi> 111. that then came the Statute of <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. and impowers a Deviſe by a Man's laſt Will and Teſtament in writing; but ſtill 'tis by his laſt Will. And ſo is <hi>Littleton ſect.</hi> 168. If divers Wills, the latter ſhall ſtand, and the others are void, 1 <hi>Inſt.</hi> 112. In truth 'tis plain Law, the firſt Grant and the laſt Teſtament. In <hi>Swinb.</hi> 1 <hi>part, ſect.</hi> 5. <hi>p.</hi> 14. no Man can die with two Wills, but he may with divers Codicils; and the latter doth not hinder the former, ſo long as they be not contrary. Another difference there is between Wills and Codi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils: If two Teſtaments be found, and it can't be known, which is firſt or laſt, both are void; but the latter countermands the firſt, tho' there be a Clauſe in the firſt, that it ſhall not be revoked, and tho' an Oath were taken not to revoke; becauſe the Law is ſo, that the very making of a latter doth revoke the former: So is <hi>Liuwood</hi>'s <hi>Provincial' de Teſtamentis;</hi> Juſtice <hi>Dodderidge</hi>'s <hi>Office of Executor,</hi> publiſhed by <hi>Wentworth</hi> 29. A verbal Will revokes a former written Will, <hi>Forſe</hi> and <hi>Hembling,</hi> 4 <hi>Rep.</hi> 60, 61. <hi>Plowd.</hi> 541. <hi>Perkins ſect.</hi> 178, 179. and <hi>ſect.</hi> 478. The 2 <hi>Hen.</hi> 5.8. is full to this purpoſe. There's an Action by an Executor againſt two Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, and they plead a Teſtament whereby they are made Executors; and the Plaintiff replys, that he afterwards made another and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf Executor, and held that by the ſecond the firſt became void. Now the meaning of theſe Books, cannot be, that a Will expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly revoking, is the only Will that can make a Revocation; nor is it, that a Contrariety or Repugnance between the one and the other, is neceſſary to make a Revocation; for tho' there be no
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:50172:81"/>new Will made, yet a Revocation may be by word of Mouth, as 2 <hi>Cro.</hi> 49.115. 1 <hi>Cro.</hi> 51.3 <hi>Cro.</hi> 781. nay, a void Bequeſt ſhall revoke a Will, ſo ſhall a Deed that hath no effect, as Feoffment without livery, a Deviſe to <hi>J.S.</hi> or to a Corporation, when there is no ſuch, will do it; ſo that 'tis not the Contradiction between the diſpoſal which revokes, for that which is no diſpoſition at all will do it; wherefore the meaning of the Authors cited is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what elſe; and it can only be this, That there is ſomewhat par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular in a Will, to that Inſtrument of Conveyance, more than to any other, that even the making of a new Will is a ſufficient Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation; the words are plain, by the making a new Will the former are all deſtroyed, for there can be but one laſt. And when a Man makes and declares a new Will, that new Will muſt be preſumed to contain his whole Mind concerning the diſpoſition of his Eſtate; declaring his Will imports thus much, and excludes all other. When a Man would alter part of his Will, there's a proper Inſtrument for it, called a Codicil, which is known in the Law as well as that of a Will: here's nothing found of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to the former: to judge it otherwiſe, would confound the uſe of Wills and Codicils, and the difference between them. 'Tis true, that a Man may make partial Wills of ſeveral parts of his Eſtate, and all may ſtand together; but then they muſt be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to be Wills concerning particular things; and they are but ſeveral pieces of the ſame Will, tho' written in different Papers: but then in pleading one of them, you muſt not generally ſay he made <hi>ult' voluntatem,</hi> but <hi>ultimam voluntat'</hi> of ſuch a thing: but here 'tis <hi>aliud teſtamentum,</hi> i.e. a general Teſtament. The 2 <hi>Rich.</hi> 3. <hi>fol.</hi> 3. is directly thus, The Defendant pleads one Will, the Plaintiff replies another, and exception taken, becauſe he did not traverſe the former, but held needleſs to do ſo, <hi>quia per ult' teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum ut placitatur generaliter, primum teſtamentum revocatur in omnibus:</hi> and it cannot be pretended, that this might be the ſame Will written over again; for if ſo, it could not be <hi>aliud,</hi> it would be the ſame; theſe are not quibbles upon words; for can it be ſaid, that this is a Deviſe by the laſt Will of Sir <hi>H.</hi> when there's another: Nor is it an Objection, that the Contents do not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear; for the Will belongs not to the Heir to keep, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently not to ſhew; in pleading he is not bound to a <hi>profert;</hi> 'tis enough that there was a ſubſequent Will. And as the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter may confirm or be conſiſtent with the former, ſo it may not be ſo; and the conſiſtency is not to be preſumed, eſpecially againſt an Heir at Law, and in poſſeſſion. In the Caſe of <hi>Coward</hi> and <hi>Marſhal,</hi> 3 <hi>Cro.</hi> 721. the Subſtance of both are declared, and thereby they appeared to be conſiſtent, and conſequently no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation: here <hi>Eadem mens ſic teſtandi,</hi> the ſame intent of diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing his Eſtate the ſame way, can never be thought to continue, for then there had been no occaſion of making another Will. If this be not a Revocation, 'tis an act void, and to no purpoſe, which is never to be intended. Then 'twas inſiſted on, That the bare act of making and publiſhing another Will, is a Revocation,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:50172:81"/>and the finding of the Contents unknown is void: If this be not a Will, 'tis a Codicil, and that is contrary to the finding of the Jury; for the Verdict mentions a ſecond Subſtantive indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Will, without reference to the former; which ſecond Will is a Revocation: and therefore 'twas prayed that the Judgment ſhould be reverſed.</p>
            <p>It was argued on the other ſide, in behalf of Mr. <hi>Noſworthy,</hi> That this was no Revocation; that here had been a great ſtir about nothing, for that nothing appeared againſt his Title; that a Man may make a Will of ſeveral things at ſeveral times, and they both ſhall ſtand; that a deliberate Will being made, the Contents where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of are known, ſhall never be revoked by that which is not known: nothing can be judged upon that which doth not appear, and conſequently it can never be judged to be a Revocation: Here's another Will, and nothing is given by it, nothing is found to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by this ſubſequent Will. The form of entring the ancient Judgments was, <hi>Quibus viſis lectis &amp; auditis &amp; per Curiam plene intellectis,</hi> now what is here read to make a Revocation. 2 <hi>Rich.</hi> 3. <hi>fol.</hi> 3. is with the Judgment, for there 'tis replied that he made ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Executor; there are the Contents pleaded, ſufficient to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain his Count, and anſwer the Defendant's Bar; the Book is, <hi>per hoc quod alius Executor nominatur.</hi> Then was cited 1 <hi>Cro.</hi> 51. the Reaſon given is, <hi>quia in dubiis non preſumitur pro teſtamento,</hi> and here being a good Will, at the moſt the other is doubtful. 1 <hi>Cro.</hi> 114, 115. Several Wills of ſeveral things may be made. And the ſame Book 595. 10 <hi>Car.</hi> 1. which Refolution Serjeant <hi>Maynard</hi> in arguing this Caſe below, ſaid that he heard in that Court of <hi>Kings Bench:</hi> 'Tis the Subject Matter of the Wills and the Repugnancy which makes the Revocation. In this very Caſe, in the <hi>Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer,</hi> upon an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Bill, 'twas held by <hi>Hale</hi> to be no Revocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, 'tis in <hi>Hardres</hi> 375. <hi>Coke</hi> upon <hi>Littleton,</hi> which hath been quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, Comments upon theſe words <hi>ſeveral Deviſes,</hi> and if there be no Deviſe in the ſecond, there can be no ſenſe or meaning in it, and conſequently unleſs ſome meaning appear, it can never be an Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of a change of his Mind; as it might be a Revocation, ſo it might be otherwiſe; and he that will have it to be a Revocation, muſt prove it to be ſuch: No Man can affirm that every Will muſt neceſſarily be a Revocation of a former, for the ſecond Will might be of another thing, as Goods, or of another parcel of Land, or in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of the former. If in theſe, and many other like Caſes, a latter Will is no Revocation of a former, how can it poſſibly with juſtice be concluded, that a latter Will without Contents, Purport, or Effect, ſhall be a Revocation of a former. And tho' the Jury have in this Caſe believed the Witneſſes, and found that another Will was made, it may be of dangerous Conſequence to encourage and conſtrue this a Revocation, without knowing the Contents; for no Will can be ſecure againſt the ſwearing of a new Will, if there be no neceſſity of ſhewing it, or proving what it was. For which, and other Reaſons, it was prayed that the Judgment might be affirmed, and it was affirmed.</p>

            <p>WRit of Error to Reverſe a Judgment given in <hi>B. R.</hi> upon a Special Verdict on a Trial at Bar in Ejectment brought by <hi>Thomſon</hi> on the Demiſe of <hi>Charles Leach:</hi> the Special Verdict finds, that <hi>Nicholas Leach</hi> was ſeized of the Lands in queſtion in his Demeſne as of Fee; and being ſo ſeized 9 <hi>Nov.</hi> 19 <hi>Car.</hi> 2. he makes his laſt Will, and thereby deviſes the Premiſſes to the Heirs Males of his Body lawfully to be begotten; and for default of ſuch Iſſue, to <hi>Simon Leach</hi> his Brother for his Life, and after his Deceaſe to the firſt Son of the Body of the ſaid <hi>Simon</hi> lawfully to be begotten, and the Heirs Males of the Body of ſuch firſt Son lawfully to be begotten; and for default of ſuch Iſſue, to the ſecond, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſo on to the eighth Sons, &amp; of all and every other Sons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and for default of ſuch Iſſue, to Sir <hi>Simon Leach,</hi> his Kinſman, Son and Heir of <hi>Simon Leach</hi> of <hi>Cadley in Com' Devon'</hi> Eſq; deceaſed, and the Heirs Males of his Body; and for default of ſuch Iſſue, to the right Heirs of him the ſaid <hi>Nicholas</hi> for ever.</p>
            <p>Then they find, That the Lands in the Declaration, and thoſe in the Will, are the ſame; that afterwards, <hi>viz.</hi> 10 <hi>Apr.</hi> 20 <hi>Car.</hi> 2. <hi>Nicholas</hi> died ſeized without Iſſue of his Body; that after his Death, the ſaid <hi>Simon</hi> his Brother and Heir Entred, and was ſeized in his Demeſne <hi>ut de libero tenemento</hi> for term of his Life, Remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the firſt Son of the Body of the ſaid <hi>Simon</hi> the Brother, and the Heirs of the Body of ſuch firſt Son lawfully to be begotten; and for default of ſuch to the ſecond, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Remainder to Sir <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> in Tail, Remainder to the ſaid <hi>Simon</hi> the Brother, and his Heirs belonging.</p>
            <p>That <hi>Simon Leach</hi> the Brother being ſo ſeized, afterwards <hi>viz.</hi> 20 <hi>Aug.</hi> 20 <hi>Car.</hi> 2. took to Wife <hi>Anne</hi> the Daughter of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nton Crook,</hi> that afterwards the 20 <hi>Aug.</hi> 25 <hi>Car.</hi> 2. he being ſo ſeized did Make, Seal, and as his Deed deliver a certain Writing, purporting a Surrender of the ſaid Lands to the ſaid Sir <hi>Simon Leach,</hi> which Writing was <hi>prout,</hi> &amp;c. Then they find that the ſaid <hi>Simon Leach</hi> the Brother, <hi>non fuit compes mentis ſue tempore confectionis, ſigilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionis, &amp; deliberationis ſcripti illius,</hi> &amp;c. That afterwards, <hi>viz.</hi> 10 <hi>Nov.</hi> 25 <hi>Car.</hi> 2. the ſaid <hi>Simon</hi> the Brother had Iſſue of his Body, on the Body of the ſaid <hi>Anne</hi> his Wife <hi>Charles Leach;</hi> that the ſaid <hi>Simon</hi> died, and <hi>Charles Leach</hi> the Leſſor of the Plaintiff is eldeſt Son and Heir of the ſaid <hi>Simon,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Et ſi videbitur Cur' quod,</hi> &amp;c. Upon this Verdict there was Judgment for the Plaintiff.</p>
            <pb n="151" facs="tcp:50172:82"/>
            <p>And now it was argued, That the ſaid Judgment was Errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; and ſaid that in the Caſe there were two Queries, 1. If this were a good Surrender, there being no Acceptance or Agreement by Sir <hi>Simon</hi> before the Birth of the firſt Son, <hi>Charles:</hi> But this was not inſiſted on before, and therefore waived here, the ſame ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been adjudged by the Lords to be a good Surrender, even to an Infant without Acceptance, in another Action between the ſame Parties, which you may ſee reported in 2 <hi>Ventris</hi> 198, 208. Then it was argued on the ſecond Query, That the Leſſor of the Plaintiff in the Ejectment, being a Remainder Man in Tail, cannot take any Advantage of his Father's Lunacy: That in this Caſe he could claim no Title, as Heir at Law, to his Father or Uncle, becauſe of the intermediate Remainder to the Defendant in Tail; ſo that <hi>quoad</hi> this Eſtate, he is as a meer Stranger, and not as Heir; and tho' he were able to avoid it by Writ, or the like, yet it being once good, the particular Eſtate of <hi>Simon</hi> the Father of <hi>Charles</hi> was determined, before the Contingent Remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the firſt Son could take place, and conſequently it can never after revive. Then the Queſtion is, Whether this Surren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der by a <hi>Non compos,</hi> being an act done by himſelf, and not by Attorney, be void or only voidable: There's no expreſs Caſe that a Surrender, by one who is <hi>Non compos</hi> to him in Remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, is void. Perhaps 'twill be ſaid, as it hath been, That the Acts of a Madman are meer Nullities by all Laws in the World. But to this 'tis an Anſwer, That the Laws of <hi>England</hi> have made good and honeſt Proviſions for them, ſo as to avoid their Acts for the Benefit of the Party, of the King and of the Heir. But it was repeated, that this was a Contingent Remainder, and if it could not veſt when the particular Eſtate did determine, whether by Death or Surrender, it never could veſt at all; for a future Right to defeat the Surrender, as Heir, cannot ſupport ſuch a Contingency; a preſent right of Entry would; but if no ſuch preſent right, the Remainder is gone for ever; and here was no ſuch in <hi>Charles.</hi> If Tenant for Life make a Feoffment with condition of Re-entry, the Contingent Remainder ſhall never ariſe again, tho' the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition be broken, and a Re-entry were made. So is the Caſe of <hi>Purefoy</hi> verſus <hi>Rogers,</hi> 2 <hi>Saund.</hi> 380. <hi>Wigg</hi> verſus <hi>Villers,</hi> 2 <hi>Rolls Abridg.</hi> 796. and then <hi>Charles</hi> cannot avoid this Deed; for the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voiding of a Deed, is to take ſomewhat out of the way, in order to the reveſting of ſomewhat; but here was nothing to work up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for if the Surrender were good for a Moment, the particular Eſtate for Life was once gone, and conſequently for ever; and this muſt hold, unleſs the Act were totally void.</p>
            <p>Then 'twas argued, That during the Life of the Party, 'twas only voidable for the King by Office; no Man can Stultifie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; and ſo is the great Reſolution in <hi>Beverly</hi>'s Caſe, 4 <hi>Rep.</hi> and 1 <hi>Inſt.</hi> 247. and <hi>Whittingham</hi>'s Caſe, 8 <hi>Rep.</hi> and if it be not void as to himſelf, it cannot be void as to others. And tho' <hi>Fitzh.</hi> in his <hi>N. B.</hi> ſays that he himſelf may have a <hi>dum non fuit compos,</hi> that is not agreeable to the received Law; for <hi>Beverly</hi>'s Caſe was never
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:50172:83"/>ſhaken till now; and <hi>Fitzh.</hi> ſuppoſes it only voidable, by ſaying that Writ doth lye. There is alſo a Reaſon for this Rule of Law, that a Man ſhall not diſable himſelf by pretence of Diſtraction, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe if the Pretence were true, he had no memory, and conſequently could not know or remember that he did ſuch an Act, and therefore 'tis, as it were, impoſſible for him to be able to ſay that he was ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted when he did it: 'tis for him to ſay what 'tis not poſſible for him to know: But they would compare this to the Caſe of an Infant, yet even there all his Acts are not void; his Bond is only avoida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; he cannot plead that 'tis not his Deed: 'Tis true, that Acts apparently to his prejudice cannot be good, as 1 <hi>Cro.</hi> 502. Suppoſe a <hi>Non compos</hi> Signs, Seals, and Delivers ſuch a Deed, and after reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers his Senſes, and agrees to it, would not this be a good Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render from the firſt, <hi>Perkins ſect.</hi> 23. 1 <hi>Inſt.</hi> 2. and if it can be made good by a ſubſequent Agreement, 'twas not totally void, and if not totally void, 'tis with the Plaintiff in Error: The Law beſides is very tender in caſe of Freeholds, to make Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyances void by bare Averments; and this would be of danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Conſequence, if when there was no Inquiſition or Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Lunacy during Life, that thirty or forty years after a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance, it ſhould be in the power of a Stranger to ſay, that the Vendor was mad; 'twill make Purchaſors unſafe: Acts ſolemnly done, ought to have a ſolemn Avoidance. The 1 <hi>Hen.</hi> 5. <hi>cap.</hi> 5. Fine to be void; 'tis void as a Bar, but yet it makes a Diſconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance, and muſt be ſolemnly avoided. <hi>Lincoln</hi> Colledge Caſe, 3 <hi>Rep. Stroud</hi> and <hi>Marſhal,</hi> 3 <hi>Cro.</hi> 398. <hi>Dett ſur Oblig'</hi> The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant pleads that at the time, he was of <hi>non ſane</hi> memory, and on demurrer adjudged no Plea; and the Opinion of <hi>Fitzh.</hi> held not to be Law. And 3 <hi>Cro.</hi> 622. 50 <hi>Aſſiſ.</hi> 2. <hi>Fitzh. Iſſue</hi> 53. a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe by a <hi>Non compos,</hi> which is much the ſame with a Surrender, only one works upwards, and the other downwards; and after Recovery the Party agrees to it, the ſame is binding, 39 <hi>Hen.</hi> 6.42. and 49 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3.13. Then was mentioned the Proviſion of the Law in theſe Caſes, beſides the Care of the Court of <hi>Chancery,</hi> which protects the weak and unwary by Rules of Equity. There's a Writ <hi>de Ideota Inquirend',</hi> and the expreſs direction of the Writ is to enquire <hi>quas terras alienavit,</hi> which ſhews that 'tis not void. The Statute of <hi>Prerogativa Regis,</hi> is expreſs Authority for it; the Reaſon given is, that ſuch Perſons Lands ſhould not be aliened to their hurt or the King's. It muſt be agreed, that before Office found the King cannot avoid the Alienation, even of an Ideot: and then after Office, the Practiſe is to Iſſue a <hi>Scire facias</hi> to him in poſſeſſion, or to the Alienee; and ſo is <hi>Fitzh. tit. Scire facias pl.</hi> 2. 106. All theſe Methods preſcribed by the Law would be uſeleſs, if the Acts themſelves were void: Then 'tis as certain, that the Office muſt be found during the Parties Life, and during the inſanity, and not afterwards. If there had been an Office, 'twould only avoid it with a proſpect, as it would be in caſe of an Heir after death: Even after an Office, the King cannot have the Profits from the time of the Alienation, which ſhews it not
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:50172:83"/>it not void from the beginning. If a Suit be againſt an Ideot after Inquiſition, the Ideot cannot plead it, but the King ſhall ſend a <hi>Superſedeas</hi> to the Judges, ſuggeſting the Inquiſition; ſo that even then the Party himſelf cannot avoid it.</p>
            <p>As to the other way of avoiding it by the Heir, it muſt be by Writ or Entry; and till Entry or Writ the Act remains good. But here's no Conteſt with the Party himſelf, or with his Heirs, but with a Remainder Man. This Act of Surrender was no tortious Act, it wrought no diſcontinuance: there was no Truſt in him to preſerve the Contingent Remainder: A Feoffment with livery is allowed not to be void, and yet that may do a wrong by diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As to the pretence that a Warrant of Attorney to make livery is void, that doth not reach this Caſe; for here's an Act done by himſelf, which would have paſſed the Eſtate as by and from himſelf, if he had been of ſound Mind.</p>
            <p>Then 'twas deſired that the other ſide would ſhew any ſuch Caſe as this, whereas multitudes of Gifts, Grants, Releaſes, Bonds, and other Specialties, ſealed and delivered by the Party himſelf, are allowed to be good; and the ſame reaſon holds for a Surren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der made in Perſon; and there's no difference between a livery made in Perſon and a Surrender; the Act being Perſonal, and not by another under his Authority, makes the livery good; and ſo it ought to be here: 18 <hi>Ed.</hi> 4.2. <hi>Perkins ſect.</hi> 139. And 'tis obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable in 39 <hi>Hen.</hi> 6.42. <hi>per Priſcott,</hi> upon the Inquiſition, 'tis re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeized and reveſted into the Intereſt of the Ideot, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the King: and if reveſted, 'twas once out of him. Now here's no prejudice to the Man himſelf by this Opinion; he is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken care of, and his Acts avoided by the King on his behalf; and his Heirs may avoid them: But that Strangers ſhould take notice of them as void, was denied; and therefore prayed that the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhould be reverſed.</p>
            <p>On the other ſide it was argued with the Judgment, That this never was a Surrender; that 'twas againſt ſenſe and reaſon, to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Acts of a Madman, a Perſon diſtracted, to be valid to any purpoſe; that in caſe of livery it had been allowed to be only voidable, by reaſon of the ſolemnity and notoriety of the thing; but in caſe of a Deed, or a Thing paſſing only by Deed, 'twas otherwiſe; and <hi>Bracton, Britton, Fleta,</hi> and the Regiſter were cited, where 'tis declared who can take, and who can alien, and that a Madman cannot alien; and <hi>Fitzh.</hi> is of Opinion, that the Writ of <hi>dum non fuit compos</hi> may be brought by himſelf; that there was a notion ſcattered in the Books, that ſuch Acts are only voidable; but the reaſon of the Law is otherwiſe. 39 <hi>Hen.</hi> 6.42. hath the diſtinction; that Feoffment with livery is good, but if livery be by Warrant of Attorney, 'tis void: If it be a Feoffment with Warranty by Deed, and poſſeſſion delivered with his own hands, yet the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranty is void, becauſe the Deed is void. <hi>Perk.</hi> 5. The Deed of a Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is void: if he grants a Rent, 'tis void. If an Infant makes a War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of Attorney, 'tis void; ſo is <hi>Whittingham</hi>'s Caſe: A Deed and a Will are not to be diſtinguiſhed; and by the ſame reaſon that the one is void, the other is ſo. <hi>Finch.</hi> 102. is general; All Deeds
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:50172:84"/>of a Man of <hi>non ſane memorie</hi> are null: 12 <hi>Rep. Shulter</hi>'s Caſe, 'Tis an offence to procure a Deed from him. The Civil Law makes all his Acts, which he doth without conſent of his Curator, to be void: A Madman is taken <hi>pro abſente:</hi> 'Tis a Rule unaccounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, That a Man ſhall not ſtuitifie himſelf; that he ſhall not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to excuſe himſelf by the Viſitation of Heaven, when he may plead Dureſs from Men, to avoid his own Act. 'Tis abſurd to ſay, That a Deed procured from a Man in a Fever, or in <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> ſhall be valid to any purpoſe. <hi>Fitzherbert,</hi> who was a good Lawyer, ridicules the pretence, and maintains, That he himſelf may avoid ſuch Act. Then were cited 2 <hi>Inſt.</hi> 14. <hi>Lloyd</hi> and <hi>Gregory,</hi> 1 <hi>Cro.</hi> 501, 502. <hi>Perkins tit. Grant.</hi> 13. Then it was ſaid, That in this Caſe there needs not much Argument, the Reaſon of the Thing expoſes the pretended Law. And the Judges have declared that this Surrender is void; the word <hi>amens</hi> or <hi>demens,</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply that the Man hath no Mind, and conſequently could make no Conveyance. Wherefore 'twas prayed that the Judgment ſhould be affirmed; and without much debate it was accordingly affirmed.</p>

The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondents, as Heirs, inſiſt upon the Deeds as a Revocation; and their Heirſhip was thus: <hi>Theophilus</hi> Earl had Iſſue <hi>Edward, Ka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tharine, Arabella,</hi> and <hi>Margaret; Edward</hi> died in the Life time of <hi>Theophilus,</hi> leaving Iſſue <hi>Edward</hi> late Earl of <hi>Lincoln; Katharine</hi> by Sir <hi>George Booth</hi> had Iſſue the Reſpondent <hi>Veer Booth; Arabella</hi> by <hi>Robert Roll</hi> had Iſſue <hi>Samuel Roll;</hi> and <hi>Margaret</hi> married <hi>Hugh Buſcowen,</hi> and had Iſſue the Reſpondent <hi>Bridget Forteſcue.</hi> And the Court, aſſiſted with the two Chief Juſtices, and Mr. Juſtice <hi>Powel</hi> ſaw no Cauſe to relieve the Appellant.</p>
            <p>And now it was argued with the Appeal, That the Diſmiſſion was Erroneous, there being Cauſe for Relief, for that the Marriage never did take effect, nor any ſerious Overture or Treaty was made by the ſaid Earl on that behalf; ſo as the ſaid Earl did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue, and at the time of his death was ſeized of the ſame Eſtate in the Premiſſes he had at the time of making and publiſhing the Will; that if at Law the Deeds of Leaſe and Releaſe were in ſtrictneſs a revocation of the Will, yet in Equity they ought not to be conſtrued a Revocation of the ſaid Will, ſo often and ſo ſolemnly and deliberately made and publiſhed, and upon ſo good a Conſideration as the ſupport of the Honour; that the ſaid Will was the Reſult of the Earls continued Intentions throughout his Life, and the Deeds were only the effect of ſome ſudden Fancy or Paſſion; and even by thoſe Deeds no benefit was deſigned to the Reſpondents; for the diſpoſition of the Surplus of what
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:50172:85"/>ſhould be raiſed by the Sale, was to be to his Executor Sir <hi>F. C.</hi> the Appellants Father; and that did evidence a continued Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to him, who never had offended him, and no regard to the Reſpondents, who (tho' they were his Heirs general) were rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted only at a diſtance, and ſcarcely known by him; and very well provided for, by great Portions raiſed out of the Eſtate for their Mothers.</p>
            <p>Then 'twas argued that this Eſtate was meerly an equitable one, and conſequently Equity only ought to govern the diſpoſition of it: here's no expreſs Revocation pretended; that a Mortgage in Fee is no Revocation, for in Equity it doth not make the Eſtate anothers: Here is a Noble Peer, who is to ſit in the Seat or Place of his Anceſtors, and therefore no Preſumption, Intendment or forced Implication ought to be againſt him or his Intereſt; that this was deſigned to take effect, in caſe the Marriage was had, and not otherwiſe; that here was no intention to revoke, but upon the Contingency of his Marriage: And there was cited <hi>Zouch</hi> and <hi>Barker</hi>'s Caſe 1625. in the Lord <hi>Coventry</hi>'s time, <hi>Chancery Rep.</hi> and the Lord <hi>Boucher</hi>'s Caſe in <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth's time; the Caſe was ſaid to be in <hi>Dyer,</hi> left as a Query, and in 1 <hi>Rolls Abridg.</hi> And for theſe, and many other Reaſons and Authorities urged, 'twas prayed that the Diſmiſſion ſhould be Reverſed, and the Appellant Relieved.</p>
            <p>On the other ſide 'twas inſiſted, That tho' this was not an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Revocation by the uſe of words declaring it to be ſuch, yet 'twas a true, legal, and effectual Revocation; that theſe Deeds of Leaſe and Releaſe did alter the Eſtate; that here 'twas for payment of Debts, as well as in conſideration of the intended Marriage; that here was a manifeſt change of his Intention; that both Will and Deed were voluntary and inconſiſtent, and therefore the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter muſt ſtand; that here were no Children or Creditors claiming under the Will; that tho' the Subject Matter were an equitable Intereſt, yet Equity ought to follow the Rules of Law; that the Law made this a good Revocation, and Equity ought to judge it the ſame way, unleſs Fraud were proved to be uſed in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing of the Execution of theſe Deeds; that the reaſon why a Mortgage even in Fee, is not a Revocation, is becauſe a Mort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage doth carry upon the face of it a Defeaſance; 'tis not reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an Inheritance to the Heir of the Mortgage, but ſhall be Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Eſtate, and Aſſets to pay the Mortgagee's Debts. This Deed was revocable by an after Will, which ſhews the Party to have no regard for any former Will, nor is there any reference to the Will then in being: If a Marriage had happened, 'twould be agreed to have been a Revocation; and if ſo, when was the Will revoked? by what Act? by the Deed, or by the Marriage? That it was ſaid that it certainly would have been revoked by the Deed, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ought to be conſtrued a Revocation, tho' no Marriage did enſue: Revocations are the ſame in Equity as at Law; and ſo was it held in the Caſe of the Earls of <hi>Bathe</hi> and <hi>Mountague.</hi>
               <pb n="157" facs="tcp:50172:85"/>The Statute of Frauds never was thought to extend to ſuch Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations as theſe: Tho' Earl <hi>Edward</hi>'s Intentions were once to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the Honour with the Eſtate, yet it was always in his power to alter it: The Leaſe and Releaſe paſſed the Equity of Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and conſequently 'tis the ſame now, between the Appellant and Reſpondents, as if there had been no Mortgage in the Caſe.</p>
            <p>'Twas further urged, That a Will is but an imperfect Convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, inchoate only, and ambulatory (as the Books term it) till the death of the Party; and another Will may revoke it, and with greater reaſon may a Deed, which alters the Eſtate, and ſhews a change of the Intention of the Perſon who was Owner of it: There's no need of a Conſideration to warrant the Revocation of a Will; there needs no reaſon to be given for it; 'tis only the Mind of the Party which both makes and revokes the Will. A Will is only the ſignification of a Man's purpoſe, how his Eſtate ſhall go after his death; and tho' it be ſolemnly made in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, ſigned, publiſhed, and atteſted, yet if he do any inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Act, whereby it muſt be neceſſarily inferred, that ſuch Purpoſe and Intention of his did not continue, the Conſequent muſt be, that what was done before, as to ſuch Will, is totally defeated; and unleſs it be ſet up anew by a Republication, 'tis as no Will. The Caſe of <hi>Mountague</hi> and <hi>Jeffryes,</hi> 1 <hi>Rolls Abridg.</hi> 615. and <hi>Moore</hi> 429. proves this: If a Conveyance at Law ſhews an Intent different from the Will as to Lands, 'twill be a Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, tho' ſuch Conveyance be not perfect to all purpoſes. <hi>Hodgkinſon</hi> verſus <hi>Wood, Cro. Car.</hi> 23. 'Tis a Revocation, tho' the Owner ſhould be in again, as of his old Reverſion. The Caſe of <hi>Leſtrange</hi> and <hi>Temple</hi> 14 <hi>Car.</hi> 2. reported in <hi>Sid.</hi> 90. 1 <hi>Keble</hi> 357. is ſtronger; but this is ſtronger yet, becauſe 'tis not to the old uſe, but limited in a different manner; 'tis a qualified Fee, and to be determined upon the qualifications taking effect, and ſo cannot be the old Eſtate; and if it were, yet 'tis a Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and there's no Circumſtance in the Caſe, that can direct a Court of Equity to differ from the Law; and therefore it was prayed, that the Decree of Diſmiſſion might be affirmed; and it was affirmed.</p>

Then they find that 1 <hi>Will. &amp; Mar.</hi> intituled, An Act for enabling Lords Commiſſioners for the Great Seal to execute the Office of Lord Chancellor or Lord Keeper, and ſeveral Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes therein concerning this Matter. Then they find that <hi>John</hi> Earl of <hi>Clare</hi> was by Letters Patents, dated the 9th day of <hi>July, Anno</hi> 1 <hi>Will. &amp; Mar.</hi> according to the 37 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. made <hi>Cuſtos Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulorum</hi> for the County of <hi>Middleſex,</hi> and ſet forth the Letters Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents in <hi>haec verba.</hi> Then they find that the Office of Clerk of the Peace for this County being void, the Earl of Clare by writing under his Hand and Seal, dated 19 <hi>July Anno primo,</hi> did nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, appoint, and conſtitute the Plaintiff, Mr. <hi>Harcourt,</hi> to be Clerk of the Peace for <hi>Middleſex,</hi> for ſo long time only, as he ſhould well demean himſelf therein, and the Inſtrument was found in <hi>haec verba.</hi> Then they find him to be a Perſon reſident in the County, capable and ſufficient to have and execute the Office; that he took upon him the execution of the ſaid Office; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he did ſo, he at the Quarter Seſſions for the ſaid County, in open Seſſions, took the Oath required by the late Act of this King, and the Oath of Clerk of the Peace, and did do and perform all things neceſſary to make him a compleat Officer; and that du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring all the time he did execute the ſald Office he demeaned him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf well.</p>
            <p>Then 'tis found, That on the fifth of <hi>February, Anno tertio,</hi> the ſaid Earl of <hi>Clare</hi> was in due manner removed from being <hi>Cuſtos,</hi> and <hi>William</hi> Earl of <hi>Bedford,</hi> by Letters Patents dated the ſixth of <hi>February,</hi> was made <hi>Cuſtos</hi> according to the 37 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. and thoſe Letters Patents are alſo found in <hi>haec verba.</hi> Then they find an Appointment in Writing, dated the fifteenth of <hi>February</hi> by the ſaid Earl, of the ſaid <hi>Fox</hi> to be Clerk of the Peace for the ſaid County, to hold the ſaid Office for and during the time the Earl ſhould enjoy and exerciſe the ſaid Office of <hi>Cuſtos,</hi> ſo as he well demean himſelf therein.

<pb n="159" facs="tcp:50172:86"/>to be to the value of five ſhillings, <hi>Sed utrum,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Et ſi,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Et ſi,</hi> &amp;c. Upon this Judgment was given for the Plaintiff be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.</p>
            <p>And it was now argued for the Plaintiff in the Writ of Error, That this Judgment ought to be Reverſed. And firſt it was ſaid, that whatſoever the Common Law was, as to ancient Offices, could be no Rule in this Matter: Many and moſt of thoſe were for Life; but my Lord <hi>Coke</hi> ſays, That the Office of Chancellor of <hi>England</hi> could not be granted to any one for Life, becauſe it was never ſo granted; the like of Treaſurer: So that Cuſtom, and nothing elſe, can govern in thoſe Offices. But here can be no pretence of its being a Common Law Office; for the Common Law knew no ſuch thing as Juſtics of the Peace, to whom, they ſay, he is a Clerk: That the firſt Statute which makes Juſtices, hath no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Clerk; but 'twas meerly an Incident; ſome Perſon of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity was to officiate in that kind: And where he is called the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices Clerk, it can only be, that he was one appointed by them to make and write their Records for them; and 'tis probable, that in ancient time, he that was their Clerk was <hi>Cuſtos Rotulorum,</hi> and intruſted with the keeping of the Records; then it coming to be an honorary thing to be <hi>Cuſtos,</hi> he that was the moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent for Quality amongſt them, was appointed to that Truſt, and then he appointed his Clerk under him: For there's no ancient Statute or Law, that empowered the Chancellor to make a <hi>Cuſtos;</hi> but he making out the Commiſſion of the Peace, might very well name one of them to be Keeper of the Records, and to have the firſt place amongſt them. And ſuch Perſon might very well ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point his Deputy or Servant, who in time came to be Clerk of the Peace. We have no certain, but this is the moſt probable, Account of the thing.</p>
            <p>Then the Statute of 37 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. recites, That the Chancellor had much perverted the Inſtitution, by aſſuming to make <hi>Cuſtos's</hi> for Life, and ſo the Clerks of the Peace were for Life likewiſe. The end of that Act was not only to remove ignorant Perſons; for the Common Law it ſelf would turn any ſuch out of Office, if he be not able to perform the Duty of it; but the Grants for Life, were the great Grievance; and therefore to remedy that Miſchief the <hi>Cuſtos</hi> muſt be appointed by Bill ſigned with the King's own hand, and at his pleaſure removeable, and the Clerk of the Peace to be appointed by the <hi>Cuſtos,</hi> and to continue on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly during the time of the others continuing to be <hi>Cuſtos.</hi> This (tho' not in the Negative) doth amount to it, <hi>viz.</hi> that he ſhall continue no longer; eſpecially when the Act recites the Miſchief to be a Continuance during Life: It implies that the Clerkſhip of the Peace ſhould be never granted, for a longer Intereſt, than the <hi>Cuſtos</hi> had in his Office. The 3 and 4 <hi>Edw.</hi> 6. doth indeed repeal part of the 37 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. not by expreſs words, but by a very ſtrong Implication, by giving the Chancellor a power to nominate the <hi>Cuſtos:</hi> But the Office of Clerk of the Peace is not toucht by that
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:50172:87"/>of <hi>Edw.</hi> 6. and continues as ſettled by 37 <hi>H.</hi> 8. which is during the continuance of the <hi>Cuſtos.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then 'tis the new Statute, which gives the occaſion of the preſent Diſpute; and there's nothing in this Act, which can make ſuch an Alteration in the Law, as was below contended for: The words, <hi>So long only as he ſhall well demean himſelf,</hi> are not enlarging of his Eſtate, but Reſtrictive: and whenſover 'tis conſidered how to make a Grant for Life to be good, you muſt conſider the power and capacity of the Grantor, and how the thing is capable of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo granted; as in Caſe of Tenant in Tail or Fee, and each make a Leaſe for Life; in the latter Caſe, 'tis for the Life of the Leſſee; and in the former, for the Life of the Tenant in Tail, becauſe of the different Capacities of the Grantors: and ſo the thing it ſelf is conſiderable; here's an expreſs Statute, that ſaith it ſhall be only during the continuance of the <hi>Cuſtos;</hi> now that Proviſion is to be purſued: 'Tis ſaid, that a Grant <hi>quam diu ſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne geſſerit,</hi> is for Life; but the words themſelves do not import any ſuch thing; 'tis indeed a reſtrictive Condition which the Law impoſes upon all Offices; for Misbehaviour in any Office, if in Fee, is a Forfeiture; but the chiefeſt Conſideration is, if it be an Office that is capable of being granted for life; if it be ſo, theſe words may amount to a Grant for Life, as expounded by uſage and the nature or capacity of the Office it ſelf: but otherwiſe, if the Office be not grantable for Life, ſuch words will not give an Eſtate for Life: Theſe words ſeem only to be an Expreſſion of what the Law always implieth, tho' not particularly expreſſed. If it operate any thing, it ſeems only to have reference to the power of the Grantor, as a Reſtirction on him, and not as an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement of the Eſtate of the Grantee, eſpecially where by a Law in being there's an incapacity upon the very Office not to be grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for life.</p>
            <p>Then it was urged that the Statute of 37 <hi>H.</hi> 8. was not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed: the 3 and 4 <hi>Edw.</hi> 6. doth not alter this Matter at all; and where it did make any Alteration, the ſame is expreſly repealed by this laſt Act in queſtion. It is a ſettled Rule, that if there be two Statutes, and both conſiſtent and not contradictory, the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter can never be ſaid to repeal the former; and ſo is Dr. <hi>Foster</hi>'s Caſe 11 <hi>Rep.</hi> 5, 6. ſo it is in Wills, <hi>Hodgkinſon</hi> and <hi>Wood, Cro. Car.</hi> 23. This laſt Act of <hi>Will. et Mar.</hi> is conſiſtent with the 37 <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n.</hi> 8. the one ſays, He ſhall continue during the time that the <hi>Cuſtos</hi> doth remain ſuch, ſo as he demean himſelf well: the other ſays, He ſhall enjoy his place, ſo ſong only as he demeans him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf well in it. Now take the Office to be by the 37 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. only gran<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>able to hold during the continuance of the <hi>Cuſtos,</hi> then ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe in the ſame Act, it ſhould be ſaid to hold ſo long only as he demean himſelf well; where is the inconſiſtency or contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? And if none, then this laſt Act doth not Repeal the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer as to this Matter. And Mr. <hi>Fox</hi>'s Grant is purſuant to the Statute of <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. and Mr. <hi>Harcourt</hi>'s hath no relation to it.</p>
            <pb n="161" facs="tcp:50172:87"/>
            <p>Then 'twas argued, That 'twas unreaſonable that a <hi>Cuſtos</hi> ſhould have an Officer under him of anothers choice, when himſelf is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſponſible for the Records which ſuch Officer is concerned with. The primary Intent of this laſt Act was only to ſettle the Doubts about the Keepers of the Great Seal, not to alter the Eſtate of the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Clerk of the Peace. The Offices of the Judges in <hi>Weſtminſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hall</hi> determine with the King's Life who grants them, tho 'they are granted to hold during good behaviour. In this Act, the reaſon of uſing theſe words, was for Caution, to advertiſe them that Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>behaviour ſhould forfeit their Places. If an Alteration of the Law had been intended, they would have ſaid, for Life, ſo as he demean himſelf well, eſpecially when (as was ſaid before) he was removable for Misbehaviour by the former Laws in being. Wherefore upon the whole Matter, it was prayed that the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment might be reverſed.</p>
            <p>On the other ſide it was argued with the Judgment, That 'tis clear and apparent that this Act of <hi>W. &amp; M.</hi> was made not only to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie Doubts, and prevent Queſtions about the Office for the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtody of the Great Seal, but to ſettle the manner of naming the <hi>Cuſtos</hi> and Clerk of the Peace; and that 'tis in part introductive of a new Law; and in part a reviver of the old: But the general end was, that that Office of Clerk ſhould be filled and executed by a learned, able, honeſt Perſon, becauſe it concerns the Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of Juſtice. He is the King's Attorney in many reſpects; he not only writes the ſenſe of the Juſtices in their Orders, but draws Indictments, and upon Traverſes, he joyns Iſſue, as one <hi>qui pro Domino Rege in ea parte ſequitur,</hi> and prays Judgment for the King in many Caſes; joyns in Demurrer, when occaſion requires, and is in the Seſſions the ſame as the Clerk of the Crown is in the <hi>King's Bench.</hi> Now to accompliſh this end of having a Perſon well qualified, and to encourage and oblige him to his good Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour, it requires a Reſidence in the County; it enjoyns that the Perſon named be able; it ſubjects him to the Juriſdiction of the Juſtices, who have a daily obſervance of his demeanour; it gives them a power to remove him upon a juſt Complaint, which they could not before; it frees him from the uſual Temptation to Fraud and Corruption, by introducing him <hi>gratis &amp; ſine pretio;</hi> and to provoke his Care and Diligence; it gives him a more du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Eſtate in his Office, then he had before, when he bought it, <hi>viz.</hi> Freehold, an Eſtate for his Life: That it ſhould be ſo, is convenient; becauſe then he will be encouraged to endeavour the increaſe of his Knowledge in that Employment, which he may enjoy during Life; whereas precarious dependent Intereſts in Places tempt Men to the contrary.</p>
            <p>That this is an Eſtate for Life, appears from the words of the Act; they do direct how long he ſhall enjoy his Office; ſo long only as he ſhall behave himſelf well: If the word <hi>only</hi> had been omitted, there could be no colour for a Doubt; By 1 <hi>Inſt.</hi> 42. 'Tis an Eſtate for Life, determinable upon Misbehaviour; for during good
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:50172:88"/>Behaviour is during Life; 'tis ſo long as he doth behave himſelf well; <hi>i.e.</hi> If he behaves himſelf well in it, ſo long as he lives, he is to have it ſo long as he lives; during Life, and during good Demeanour, are therefore ſynonymous Phraſes, the ſame thing when uſed with relation to Offices; the Condition annexed, if obſerved, continues it during Life, the contrary determines it: This is the Rule and Law in caſe of Offices in general, and muſt hold in this, for this is an Office, 2 <hi>Hen.</hi> 7.1. He is called <hi>Att' Domini Regis.</hi> 'Tis ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of being enjoyed for Life, and conſequently of being grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo, eſpecially when an Act of Parliament declares it ſhall be ſo: There's nothing in the nature of the Employment that hinders it; and there can be no doubt, but that a Statute may impower a <hi>Cuſtos</hi> in poſſeſſion, who hath only an Eſtate at will, to name a Clerk to hold during Life or good Behaviour; The Juſtices are at pleaſure; Suppoſe then the Act had ſaid, That they ſhould name him in this manner, he muſt have continued, tho' they had died, or had been removed; the Caſe is the ſame here; he is as much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted with the Acts of the Juſtices, as with the Records belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the keeping of the <hi>Cuſtos.</hi> Then there's nothing in the Act that ſavours of an Intention to make him dependent on the <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtos</hi>'s Office. The <hi>Cuſtos</hi> is to name him, but the Juſtices have the controul over him; he is an Officer to the Seſſions, and the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices only can remove him. The Limitation of the Intereſt of the <hi>Cuſtos</hi> in his Office, and that of the Clerk, are different; and that ſhews that the duration of the one was not to depend on the other. Beſides, the <hi>Cuſtos</hi> is to name, not when he ſhall be made <hi>Cuſtos</hi> (as it would have been worded, if the intention ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced on the other ſide had been true) but whenſoever it ſhall be void. It doth not ſay, Every new <hi>Cuſtos</hi> ſhall, or that every <hi>Cuſtos</hi> ſhall name, but generally when 'tis void, he ſhall, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then as to the Objection, That this new Act is conſiſtent with the 37 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. and therefore that is ſtill in force? 'Twas anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, That by the former Act, he was intirely placed under the <hi>Cuſtos,</hi> who had power to diſplace him upon Miſcarriage; the Seſſions then could not do it, tho' a Court, and a Court of Record: they might ſuſpend him, but could not deprive him of his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, even for ill Demeanour: This was that Act. Now the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Law abridges the power of the <hi>Cuſtos;</hi> he muſt name a Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, before he might appoint any able Perſon; the Perſon was then removable by the <hi>Cuſtos,</hi> now only by the Juſtices; Care is taken, that nothing is to be given for the Office; and now he may make a Deputy without the approbation of the <hi>Cuſtos.</hi> Here's plainly a different Juriſdiction over him, and a different Eſtate veſted in him; this expreſs Limitation of the Intereſt to him is an Excluſion of the former Eſtate, as dependant upon that of the <hi>Cuſtos.</hi> And beſides, this is a Subſtantive diſtinct enacting Clauſe of it ſelf, and no ways relating to the Statute of <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. Why was this Limitation penned differently from that, unleſs to give another ſort of Intereſt. As to the Caſes of new Laws which repeal former, 'twas ſaid, That the Rule was certain, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:50172:88"/>Statute is introductive of a new Law, tho' penned in the affirmative, is a Repeal of the former, as implying a negative; <hi>i. e.</hi> the latter ought to be obſerved, if it concerns the ſame Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. The Statute of <hi>Edw.</hi> 6. controuled the Statute of <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. One directed the Keeper to name, the other the King, and both are in the affirmative; yet the latter muſt be obſerved. And if this be a new Eſtate (as it hath been adjudged below) then the Party ought to enjoy it. And for this was cited 1 <hi>Sid.</hi> 55. <hi>Plowd.</hi> 113. and other Books.</p>
            <p>Then 'twas ſaid, That the Clerk of the Peace, named by the Juſtices, in default of the <hi>Cuſtos,</hi> would have an Eſtate for Life; and by the ſame reaſon it ought to be ſo here: Tho' the <hi>Cuſtos</hi> be to be named, according to the Statute of <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. yet he is not to execute his Power of <hi>Cuſtos</hi> according to that Act, but is tied to a Reſident; hath not the Approbation of a Deputy, and cannot remove. By the Statute of <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. the Clerk had but an Eſtate at the will of the King, the <hi>Cuſtos</hi> having no other: This is ſo long as he doth well in his Office; theſe are different; and when the <hi>Cuſtos</hi> hath named him, he is in by the Statute. If what they on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide contend for, had been intended, there was no need of theſe words of Limitation at all; and the words, <hi>in like manner as by the former act,</hi> had fulfilled the intention, if ſuch had been.</p>
            <p>As to the word <hi>only,</hi> that would make no Alteration in the Caſe of any other Office. Suppoſe an Office granted to a Man <hi>quamdiu tantum,</hi> or <hi>ſolummodo, ſe bene geſſerit,</hi> would that give leſs then an Eſtate for Life: The word <hi>only</hi> was added, not to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge the Eſtate of the Clerk, but rather to reſtrain the Power of the <hi>Cuſtos,</hi> that he ſhould have Authority only to limit it du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring good Behaviour, and not for a leſs Intereſt or Eſtate: The <hi>Cuſtos</hi> is confined, that he ſhall not grant it for Years, or at Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. Beſides, <hi>only</hi> is but juſt ſo long, and no longer, or ſo long as; and 'tis the ſame thing with the word, as without it. <hi>Dum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modo ſola vixerit,</hi> is during all her Widowhood. Suppoſe a power to make Leaſes to hold only for and during the term of 21 Years, the ſame would be good for the whole Term. Then 'tis no Objection, That the Eſtate of the Clerk is greater than his is who names him, for that may be by Cuſtom, as in the Offices in <hi>Weſtminſter-hall, Hobart</hi> 153. and the Clerks of Aſſize, where u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage fixes the Eſtate. And the like in Caſe of Power to make Leaſes upon Family Settlements to Uſes, where Tenant for Life grants larger Intereſts then his own: 'Tis true, the Powers and Eſtates raiſed by them, iſſue out of the Inheritance, but the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant for Life only names them; as the <hi>Cuſtos</hi> doth here, tho' the Statute gives the Intereſt.</p>
            <p>As to the Inconvenience, That dependent Offices ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue againſt the will of their Superiours, that can be no Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, ſince there are few great Officers in the Realm, but have many Subſtitutes and Inferiours under them, which were named by their Predeceſſors, and are not removable; almoſt every Biſhop
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:50172:89"/>in <hi>England</hi> is under theſe Circumſtances, with reſpect to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſter of his own Court, who notes and records his Acts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This is an Exception to all Grants for Lives; but Credit ought to be given to the Honour, Wiſdom, and Judgment of former, as well as preſent Officers, in reſpect of ſuch Nominations, 'till ſome Misbehaviour ſhews the Choice to have been ill; and when that appears, the Perſons are removable, and then the Inconvenience is likewiſe removed, Here the Jury have found the Plaintiff in the Action below, to be able and ſufficient, and well qualified for the Office, and to have done his Duty in the Office, while he had it. Wherefore it was prayed that the Judgment might be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed; and it was affirmed.</p>

            <pb n="165" facs="tcp:50172:89"/>
            <p>Then the Biſhop Demurs generally, and Mr. Attorney Joyns, and Dr. <hi>Birch</hi> pleads that he is Incumbent, and then ſets forth the Statute of <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. concerning Diſpenſations; and that after Dr. <hi>Tenniſon</hi> was elected Biſhop, the Archbiſhop granted to him a <hi>Commendam Retinere,</hi> with power to take and enjoy the Profits to his own uſe, by the ſpace of ſeven Months.</p>
            <p>That this <hi>Commendam</hi> was confirmed under the Great Seal, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Statute; and the ſaid Dr. <hi>Tenniſon</hi> did enjoy the ſame accordingly, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Mr. Attorney Demurs, and Dr. <hi>Birch</hi> joyns in Demurrer, and Judgment was given for the King, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now it was argued in the firſt place, That the Plea in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batement was good; and if ſo, all that followed was Erroneous. And to make that Plea good, it was ſaid that there is a variance between the Writ and Declaration; that they are founded upon ſeveral Rights; that upon arguing the Merits of the Cauſe, it muſt be owned to be ſo, on the other ſide</p>
            <p>That no Argument can be urged to maintain the Declaration in general, but the <hi>Jure Prerogative,</hi> and conſequently it muſt be different from the Title or Intereſt <hi>pleno Jure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They have ſaid below that tho' the King's Intereſt is bound by Statutes, yet his Prerogative is not. This Diſtinction of the Rights muſt be allowed, or elſe the main Judgment is not juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; and that there is ſuch a Diſtinction, appears in <hi>Gaudy</hi> and the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi>'s Caſe in <hi>Hob.</hi> 302. by the Preſentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on there recited, which was drawn by the King's Counſel; 'tis <hi>ad noſtram Preſentation' pertinet, ſive ex pleno Jure, ſive ratione Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By <hi>Bracton</hi> 415. If the Writ be founded on one Right, and the Declaration on another, the Writ muſt be abated, as in Caſe of Executors and Corporations. In ſome Caſes it muſt be agreed, That the Writ may be General, and the Count Special; but none of thoſe Caſes will reach to this, where ſeveral Rights are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended. 'Tis no Objection to ſay, That there is no Writ in the Regiſter for this; for that's rather an Argument againſt their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative: Beſides, this Prerogative was never allowed till <hi>Dyer</hi>'s time; and in the old Books 'tis denied, where the King was not Patron.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>Regiſter</hi> 30. is a Writ Special, <hi>quod permittant nos pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentare idoneam perſonam ad Eccleſiam de,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>que vacat et ad no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stram ſpectat Donationem ratione Archiepiſcopatus</hi> Cant' <hi>nuper vacan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis in manu existentis.</hi> And another <hi>Sine titulo ut de jure,</hi> and that is General, <hi>ad nostram ſpectat Donationem.</hi> Another Writ is there <hi>Ratione custodie terre et heredis</hi> upon a Tenure <hi>in capite.</hi> And ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Ratione foris facture unius, et ratione custodie terre et heredis alterius per ſervitium.</hi> Another Writ <hi>pro Domino Rege et aliis con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctim Register</hi> 32. is another ſuch by reaſon of the Vacancy of the Archbiſhoprick.</p>
            <pb n="166" facs="tcp:50172:90"/>
            <p>'Tis not an Anſwer, That the Writ of Waſte is General, and the Count Special, becauſe that is not <hi>en auter droit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then it was ſaid that it is true, That where another Writ cannot be had, a General Writ and Special Count are allowable; but here a Special Writ might have been ſued. And there were cited the 1 <hi>Inst.</hi> 26, 53, 54, 235, 344, 3 <hi>Cro.</hi> 185, 829. And as to the Queen and the Archbiſhop of <hi>York</hi>'s Caſe 3 <hi>Cro.</hi> 340. that doth not come up to this Caſe; for tho' the Writ were General, and the Count in Right of the Dutchy of <hi>Lancaster,</hi> yet both were as Patron <hi>pleno jure;</hi> and the Count did only ſhew, how the Plaintiff came to be Patron; but here they were ſeveral Rights, as dictinct, as a Claim by a Man ſingly, and a Claim as Executor, or <hi>in jure <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>xoris.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In Anſwer to this were cited the Preſidents in <hi>Mich.</hi> 31 <hi>Hen.</hi> 6. <hi>Rot.</hi> 65. <hi>Paſch.</hi> 9 <hi>Eliz. Rot.</hi> 1408. or 1410. <hi>Hill.</hi> 13 <hi>Car.</hi> 1. <hi>Rot.</hi> 486. <hi>Trin.</hi> 31 <hi>Car.</hi> 2. <hi>Dominus Rex verſus Epiſcop' de Worcester,</hi> Writ General and Count Special, <hi>Rastal</hi> 528, 530.</p>
            <p>Then it was argued, upon the Merits of the Cauſe, as it was, appearing upon the Declaration and Plea and Demurrer: and therein three Queries were made, as had been by the King's Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel below.</p>
            <p n="1">1. If the King hath any Prerogative to preſent upon an Avoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance by Promotion, where neither himſelf, nor the Biſhop, was Patron, but another Subject.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If this <hi>Commendam Retinere,</hi> and to take the Profits to his own uſe, was not a Service of this Prerogative turn.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Suppoſing that there be ſuch a Prerogative, and that the <hi>Commendam</hi> makes no Alteration in the Caſe, then if this Vacancy of this Church be ſubject to this Prerogative.</p>
            <p>As to the firſt it was argued, That where an Incumbent is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted to the Order and Degree of a Biſhop, his Living or Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice becomes void; and that where a Biſhop is Patron, and the Advowſon and Biſhoprick are become void at a time, there the King ſhall preſent; becauſe while the Temporalties are in his hands, he is lawful Patron for that time, and conſequently had a Right to preſent, but not by virtue of any Special Prerogative; but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as a Temporary qualified Patron, like a <hi>Dominus pro Tempore</hi> of a Mannor, may do Acts of Neceſſity which regularly belong to the very true Lord himſelf; and this perhaps gave the Colour for this pretended Prerogative: and in truth it anſwers every thing, that can be ſuggeſted from any ancient Authority, whether Preſident, Book Caſe, or Opinion. It is otherwiſe where a Subject is Patron, and the King hath no Poſſeſſion of, or a Right to the Patronage at that time; In ſuch caſe he cannot preſent, and there is no Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative given by our Law, for to warrant ſuch a Right to that Preſentation.</p>
            <pb n="167" facs="tcp:50172:90"/>
            <p>All Prerogatives are founded upon ſome reaſon of Benefit to the People, either in reſpect of the Government in general, or elſe of ſome particular Subjects; but this hath neither: And in 3 <hi>Cro.</hi> 527. 'tis agreed, that there is no Reaſon for ſuch a Prerogative, but 'tis added, and the Addition is ſomewhat ſtrange, that many Prerogatives have no reaſon in them, or for them: and that 'tis unmannerly to Enquire or Doubt, if they are reaſonable; whereas it might be thought that unreaſonableneſs in the Matter contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for, had been an Argument againſt any thing but an Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Dyer</hi> 228. Sir <hi>Henry Sidney</hi>'s Caſe <hi>verſus</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter,</hi> by <hi>Dyer</hi> 'twas agreed, That the Queen had no ſuch Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative; and he adds, <hi>quod ſic alij Socii mei ſentiebant;</hi> ſo that 'twas not his ſingle Opinion againſt it, but the whole Court of <hi>C. B.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then 'twas ſaid that the ancient Law knew nothing of his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative; all the Records, Law Books, and even Hiſtories have been ſearched for the Maintenance of it, and no footſteps can be found for it: No <hi>Bracton</hi> or <hi>Fleta,</hi> no <hi>Dr.</hi> and <hi>Student,</hi> or <hi>Stamf.</hi> that treats of the <hi>Prerogative,</hi> hath any thing of it. Now all Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatives are and muſt be time out of mind, or not at all: And then, if this be not ſo, it muſt be an Uſurpation, and being not time out of mind, it cannot be a Prerogative, becauſe not part of the Common Law.</p>
            <p>In the great Caſe which they ſo much inſiſt on, of <hi>Woodley</hi> in 2 <hi>Cro.</hi> 691. Juſtice <hi>Hutton,</hi> who was an ingenious Man, a good Lawyer, and a true <hi>Engliſh</hi> Judge, that argued againſt Ship-money, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly denies, that there was any ſuch Prerogative; that the King had no Title to preſent, but where himſelf is Patron; and that there was no ſuch Preſentment, till of late days; nor any Book of Law to warrant it; but that Caſe which is in <hi>Bro. Abr. Preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment al' Eſgliſe</hi> 61.</p>
            <p>Then 'twas urged, That a few years Practiſe can no more make a Prerogative, then it can Repeal an Act of Parliament. 'Tis true, that in the Report of that Caſe, <hi>Crook</hi> ſeems to admit, that <hi>Winch</hi> was of Opinion for the Prerogative, and only <hi>Hutton</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it; for he makes <hi>Winch</hi> to ſay, That the King has an Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Title by his Prerogative, as well in the Caſe of Common Perſons Patronage, as where himſelf is ſo: But as 'tis in <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches</hi> Reports 96. where the Caſe is reported again, there they are both of Opinion againſt it; and <hi>Winch</hi> ridiculed the Opinion of <hi>Bro. Preſentment</hi> 61. as the ſaying of the Biſhop of <hi>Ely,</hi> who was then Chancellor, and might have right to preſent to it by force of his Place, if the King had ſuch a Prerogative: And indeed <hi>Bro.</hi> himſelf makes a Remark upon it, as a thing never heard of before by a <hi>quod nota.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The King hath preſented to <hi>Livings</hi> of other Mens Patronages, but that was not by force of this Prerogative, but on other grounds; as 40 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3.40. the King preſented to a Prebendary, when the Prebend was made a Biſhop: And the reaſon of that Caſe makes for the Plaintiff in Error, <hi>i.e.</hi> becauſe the Temporalties of the
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:50172:91"/>Biſhop, who was Patron of that Prebendary, was then in the King's Hands, and then the King was Patron ſo long, and he did preſent as ſuch: So is the 41 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3.5. the ſame as Patron ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Temporalties in his hand: So is 44 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3.24. upon another reaſon; a Parſon is made a Biſhop, and the King pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented not <hi>Jure Prerogative,</hi> but becauſe that the Patron was the King's Tenant <hi>in Capite,</hi> and the Heir was in Ward to the King, and ſo he had <hi>Jus Patronatus</hi> in him: The King hath it, where he has the Temporalties; ſo is <hi>Fitzh. Grand Abridgment</hi> Title <hi>Quare Impedit pl.</hi> 35. the King claimed Title to preſent to the Provoſtry of <hi>Wells</hi> in the Gift of the Biſhop, void upon the Provoſt, being made Dean, becauſe the Temporalties of the Biſhop were in the King's hands at that time</p>
            <p>The 11 <hi>Hen.</hi> 4.37, 59, and 76. tho' cited on the other ſide be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, is a full Authority; 'tis a noted Caſe, the ancienteſt Caſe in our Law concerning <hi>Commendams:</hi> The Caſe in ſhort is thus; The King brings a <hi>Quare Impedit,</hi> and makes his Title by the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the Incumbent to be a Biſhop. There was ſome Debate on the Declaration; but the Defendants plead, that the King granted the Temporalties to the new Biſhop, before the Living be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came vacant. Then the King waives that Declaration, and betakes himſelf to another Title, and Declares on the Statute of Proviſors, becauſe the Pope had uſurped a Power which that Statute denied him; and there's no Judgment in the Caſe upon the firſt point; but 'tis moſt clear, that the King's Counſel in that Caſe were of Opinion againſt this Prerogative, becauſe they did not ſtand to that Title, but amended their Declaration, and took to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>This Point was directly to have been judged in the Caſe, if they had thought fit to abide by it: So that 'tis plain that they took the Plea to be good, if the Temporalties were in the King's hands, then the King was to preſent; if not, that he had no ſuch Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative. And this is a great Authority, that the King had no ſuch Prerogative, becauſe he waives that Title and goes to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>

               </hi> Dublin' <hi>in</hi> Hibernia, <hi>(Temporalibus Epiſcopi</hi> Exon' <hi>ad tunc in manibus Regis exiſtent) per quod Dominus Rex recuperavit verſus Epiſcopum dict' Archidiaconat'.</hi> Upon this Record he makes two Concluſions;</p>
            <p n="1">1. Tho' <hi>Ireland</hi> be a diſtinct Kingdom, yet 'tis governed by the ſame Law as <hi>England</hi> in theſe Matters.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That when the Arch-Deacon was by the King preferred to an Archbiſhoprick, he had the Preſentation to the Arch-deaconry in reſpect of the Temporalties of the Biſhop of <hi>Exeter,</hi> Patron of the Arch-deaconry, and not by any Prerogative.</p>
            <p>Here 'tis obſervable, That my Lord <hi>Coke</hi> took it that the Patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage, by reaſon of the Temporalties, gave to the King this Right, and not the Prerogative.</p>
            <p>Then his next Paragraph is ſtronger, If a Biſhop in <hi>England</hi> be made a Cardinal, the Biſhoprick becomes void, and the King ſhall name his Succeſſor, becauſe the Biſhoprick is of his Patronage. All which implies, That if 'twere not of his Patronage, 'twould be otherwiſe, elſe why is that reaſon added.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> But then ſay they, The Pope's Uſurpation prevailed in all thoſe times, and the Pope had it when Proviſions were in uſe. But that can be no Argument to give the Crown a Prerogative, for the Pope was a Tyrant over the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Church, and by the ſame Reaſon the King may claim to be above all Laws, becauſe ſome Judges ſaid as <hi>Hank</hi> did in <hi>Hen.</hi> 4. <hi>quod Papa potest omnia;</hi> at that rate no Act of Parliament ſhall bind the King, becauſe the Pope thought himſelf bound by no Law of ours.</p>
            <p>Beſides, There were ſeveral of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Monarchs and <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Parliaments, that boldly withſtood theſe Uſurpations; and there were divers Intervals of Liberty and Freedom from that <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh</hi> Yoke, and we never read of any Exerciſe of this Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive in thoſe Intervals.</p>
            <p>'Tis queſtioned in 41 <hi>Eliz.</hi> and in <hi>Owen</hi>'s <hi>Rep.</hi> 'tis ſaid that the Pope's practiſe was no Authority to warrant a Prerogative, for they uſed to do ſtrange things, and the Clergy then made his Will a Law; and our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Lawyers have always complained of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> There's no ancient Books that mention Title by Lapſe. But 'twas anſwered, That in <hi>Caudries</hi> Caſe, 'tis fetch'd from the Reign of <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. and that is no very late Reign, and Lapſe is ſo ancient, as it appears by the cloſe, <hi>Roll</hi> 21 <hi>Hen.</hi> 3. in <hi>n.</hi> 12. that the De<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="170" facs="tcp:50172:92"/>an Advowſon of the King's own; but it appears there by a Writ to that purpoſe, that no Lapſe <hi>per tempus ſemestre</hi> accrued on the King; which ſhews that 'twas old Law for the Subjects, <hi>Pryn</hi> 2.481.</p>
            <p>By a Writ 8 <hi>Hen.</hi> 3. <hi>num.</hi> 4. <hi>Dorſo, Prynne</hi> 2 <hi>Vol.</hi> 389. it appears the Archbiſhop of <hi>York</hi> was to preſent <hi>ſi ultra tempus ſex menſium vasari contigerint,</hi> and 1 <hi>Inst.</hi> 2 <hi>Inst.</hi> and all the Booksare full of it, and <hi>Doctor and Student,</hi> which is no new Book, treats of it, <hi>cap.</hi> 31. Beſides, that and this are different Caſes; there is a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of ſuch a Law for the Service of the Church; the King is by the Conſtitution intruſted with the Supreme Care of his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, both for Religion and Property; and if a Patron will not do it in reaſonable time, 'tis reaſonable he ſhould loſe it, and the King preſent.</p>
            <p>But to make that a ſimilar Caſe, they ſhould ſhew that theſe Prerogatives were of equal duration; and that there's as much reaſon for the one as for the other; but becauſe the King hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred the Patron's Friend, therefore the King ſhall have it, that cannot hold upon a <hi>toties quoties</hi> when the Friend is dead, and three or four more of the King's preſenting, for by this means the Patron may never preſent to his Church.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The next Query was, Whether this <hi>Commendam</hi> for above the ſix Months, with power to take the Profits to his own uſe, ſhall be a fulfilling of this turn, or otherwiſe prevent the Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Prerogative on it; by this he was a plenary Incumbent after Conſecration, and he had the Profits to his own uſe: He was not meerly the Ordinary's Deputy to ſupply the Cure during ſix Months, but hath it in his own right, and this with the King's concurrence.</p>
            <p>The Prerogative could only work upon an Avoidance by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion, and that is upon Conſecration; this becomes void at the expiration of therein limited.</p>
            <p>Tis to be conſidered, That this is none of the old Prerogatives of the Crown, which in a Competition are to be preferred before the Subject's Right, it is a Prerogative not to be favourably interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but <hi>ſtricto Jure,</hi> for 'twas only taken up as a Papal Right, and ſo 'tis plain from 2 <hi>Rolls Abridg.</hi> 358, 359. As ſuch a Papal Right, it ought to be interpreted <hi>ſtricto Jure,</hi> even by the Pope's Law, being againſt the Patron's ordinary Right, and ſo 'tis <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re odioſe;</hi> there might be cited <hi>Suares</hi> and others to this purpoſe: Perhaps the Pope's Right was not ſo much allowed here, as to make it clear with him in this Point; for <hi>Dr. and Student, cap.</hi> 36. <hi>&amp;</hi> 37. ſays, that the Pope's Collection of Benefices <hi>vacantium in Curia,</hi> was held to be within the Statute concerning Proviſions, <hi>viz.</hi> 25 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3.</p>
            <p>This Prerogative hath been conſtrued <hi>ſtricto Jure</hi> here:</p>
            <p n="1">1. In the Caſe which the Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Vaughan</hi> Reports, where the Crown upon the promotion of an Incumbent to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoprick of <hi>Oxford</hi> (and who by Diſpenſation retained his Living till death) would have preſented to the Living when it fell vold, by the Incumbent the Biſhop's Death; it was reſolved that the King's
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:50172:92"/>Prerogative was not to preſent to the next Avoidance after the Promotion, but to the next Avoidance by the promotion which in that Caſe was none, for that the Avoidance was by Death.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In the Caſe my Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Dyer</hi> reports 228. the promoted Incumbent was diſpenſed with to retain for a term of years; within which term he reſigned; and there, upon the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidance, the Prerogative was not admitted to take place, becauſe the Avoidance was by the Reſignation, and not by the Promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Now if this Prerogative is to be interpreted <hi>ſtricto Jure,</hi> it will have no place in this Caſe, where the Incumbent promoted is diſpenſed with to retain for a term of time which is elapſed: For,</p>
            <p>The King's Prerogative will have a very Natural Conſtruction, by admitting his Title to preſent to all ſuch Avoidances, as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence immediately from and by the promotion.</p>
            <p>This is the Avoidance which the Law intends, and which the Law would always cauſe (if not hindred to operate by Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) and this Avoidance is that therefore, which the Prerogative muſt moſt principally reſpect, and only that, if it be to be ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken; inſomuch that were it in the ſole power of the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop to grant this Diſpenſation, it ſeems the King's Title would clearly be ſet aſide by it: much more therefore ſhould it be ſo, when what the Law deſigns, is prevented by the Act of the King himſelf: For tho 'the Lord <hi>Vaughan</hi> ſaith, That the King's Concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the Diſpenſation is only for formality; yet 'tis plain that the King may force the Archbiſhop to grant it.</p>
            <p>Now this Interpretation of the Prerogative ſeems to be alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy made in the Caſe cited upon a Reſignation of the Incumbent diſpenſed with, for, (as it is there intimated) if the King's Title was not ſuppoſed to be gone by the defeating of the immediate Avoidance, which the Law intended, but the King would not permit. It would be very ſtrange that it ſhould be eluded by the Reſignation of the Incumbent, to which the King was no Party; for if the King had a Prerogative to preſent to this new, this deferred, this adjourned Avoidance, it would be more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable to allow it to be haſtened, then defeated by ſuch a Reſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation before the time.</p>
            <p>This Prerogative ought to admit ſuch a Reſtriction from the reaſon of the thing, and from the conſideration of the Inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies which may otherwiſe follow.</p>
            <p>To the Subject. A Patron might be content to let the King exchange a ſingle Life, and put in a Clerk in the place of one removed, much rather then that the Living ſhould be held on by one in <hi>Commendam,</hi> that from thenceforth would be ſure to leave it, and be abſent for a better Reſidence in a Palace; yet they may, as they have reaſon, think it too hard, that the King ſhould, as it were, let a Leaſe of it firſt, and afterwards put in his Clerk for Life; and tho' the King doth commend here but for a ſmall time, yet he may for a longer. He may perhaps, as the Pope
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:50172:93"/>did often, diſpence with the Biſhop to hold <hi>durante beneplacito,</hi> and when the Incumbent is in danger of Death, then preſent ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; ſo as the Patron may have his own Clerk not removed, as was firſt intended, but diſpenſed with, to wear out his Life in the Benefice, and yet after all have another put in.</p>
            <p>The Crown may have Inconvenience by the ſtraining of it fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than this, for all ſtrains weaken, if not break the thing it ſelf.</p>
            <p>This Opinion of theirs ariſes from the Principle my Lord <hi>Vaughan</hi> lays down, That a <hi>Commendam</hi> neither gives nor takes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way Right, but only is a Diſpenſation to hold, and he continues Incumbent ſtill, and it prevents an Avoidance; and if ſo, why ſhould it not alſo prevent the operation of the Prerogative too.</p>
            <p>As to the Caſe of <hi>Woodley,</hi> 2 <hi>Cro.</hi> 691. they ſay 'tis Law, to prove the other Point for them; If it be Law for them in that Point, 'tis Law againſt them in this.</p>
            <p>That a Diſpenſation <hi>ad retinend'</hi> prevents the Grantee of the next Avoidance: The Caſe was thus; A Man hath a Grant of the next Avoidance, the Incumbent is promoted, but with a <hi>Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam Retinere</hi> for ſix years, and dies, the Grantee ſhall not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, becauſe he is to have the next Avoidance only, and no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: 'Tis the words of the Book, that when the Incumbent is created a Biſhop, and the King preſents, or grants, that he ſhall hold it in <hi>Commendam</hi> (which is <hi>quaſi</hi> a Preſentation) and he is thereby full Incumbent, and may plead as an Incumbent; if the Grantee of the next Avoidance do not then preſent, he hath loſt his Preſentation; for he ought to have the next, and he cannot have any other.</p>
            <p>Now if this be ſo that a <hi>Commendam Retinere</hi> hath ſo much of a Grant in it, and is ſo equivalent to a <hi>Commendam ad recipiend',</hi> that it will ſet aſide and fruſtrate a Grant of the next Avoidance, and be it ſelf taken for a preſentation to the next Avoidance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Grantee; by the ſame reaſon it muſt be taken ſo againſt the King, as a Preſentation to an Avoidance, and conſequently his turn is ſerved by it.</p>
            <p>Much might be ſaid againſt thoſe <hi>Commendams,</hi> as promotive of Pluralities, and tending to the ruine of the Church, and this out of our own Law-Books; but it is not material at preſent; 'tis however to be obſerved, that this is not a Commendatory for ſix Months, during the time that the Patron may forbear to preſent; ſuch Perſon continued then, is only <hi>commendatorius</hi> under the Biſhop to provide for the Church, as 'tis his Duty to take care of it during that time.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Admitting that the King hath ſuch a Prerogative, and that this <hi>Commendam,</hi> tho' it gives the full perception of the Profits, is not a fulfilling of the King's turn, nor doth any way diſtinguiſh the Caſe, or exempt it from the Prerogative: yet this is a Caſe not within it; and this doth appear of Mr. Attorney's own ſhewing in his Declaration upon the King's behalf: He hath ſet it forth to
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:50172:93"/>be a Pariſh newly created by Act of Parliament, a thing not <hi>in eſſe</hi> before. It appears by the Declaration what that Act is; it muſt be taken as 'tis there ſet forth. To this Declaration the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop hath demurred. Now if by that Declaration it appears that the Biſhop, and not the King, is rightfully intituled to preſent upon this Avoidance, the Judgment will and muſt be according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the Defendants.</p>
            <p>Mr. Attorney, by his Count, doth agree an Avoidance with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in this Act of Parliament, by the Promotion of Dr. <hi>Tenniſon;</hi> and Mr. Attorney doth likewiſe admit and agree, That the King is not Patron of this Benefice called, St. <hi>James</hi>'s; he doth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree too, That the King hath no Right given to have any Turn or Preſentment by this Act; for he ſaith, 'tis to be by the Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> and the Lord <hi>Jermyn;</hi> he doth alſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit by this Declaration, That Dr. <hi>Tenniſon</hi> was never preſented to this Living, that he came not into it by Virtue of any Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation from any particular Patron; nay, That he did not come into it by any ſort of Preſentation whatever; nay, he yet doth further agree, That this Pariſh-Church was never preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to by any Perſon at all.</p>
            <p>But he inſiſts upon it, That now it is void, the King hath a Right to preſent to it, by force of his Prerogative upon this Avoidance; tho' the Act ſaith, That the Biſhop ſhall preſent after the Deceaſe of Dr. <hi>Tenniſon,</hi> or the next Avoidance.</p>
            <p>The Query is, whether the King's Prerogative can operate up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Vacancy of this Benefice, thus filled, and thus avoided, againſt the expreſs Words of an Act of Parliament. It will be neceſſary to repeat the Words of the Act; and they are to this Effect, That all that Precinct or Diſtrict of Ground, within the Bounds and Limits there mentioned, from thenceforth, ſhould be a Pariſh of it ſelf, by the Name of the Pariſh of St. <hi>James</hi>'s, within the Liberties of <hi>Westminſter;</hi> and a Church thereupon built, is dedicated by the Act, to Divine Service, and that there ſhould be a Rector to have the Care of Souls inhabiting there; and then after a full Commendation of the Merits and Services of Dr. <hi>Tenniſon</hi> in that Place, the now Reverend the Biſhop of <hi>Lincoln:</hi> It doth Enact and Ordain him to be the firſt Rector of the ſame; and that the ſaid Doctor and his Succeſſors, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors of the ſaid Pariſh, ſhould be incorporated, and have a perpetual Capacity and Succeſſion by the Name of the Rector of the ſaid Pariſh Church; and by Virtue of that Act, ſhould be enabled by the Name aforeſaid, to ſue and be ſued, to plead and to be impleaded, in all Courts and Places within this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and ſhould have Capacity to hold and enjoy, purchaſe and acquire Lands, Tenements, and Hereditaments, to him and them, Rectors thereof, for ever, over and above what is given and ſettled by that Act, to any Value not exceeding 200 <hi>l. per Annum.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="174" facs="tcp:50172:94"/>
            <p>Then it Enacts, That the Patronage, Advowſon, or Preſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion after the Deceaſe of the ſaid firſt Rector or Avoidance thereof, ſhall or ſhould belong and appertain, and by that Act, ſhall or ſhould be veſted in the ſaid Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> for the time being, and his Succeſſors, and in <hi>Thomas</hi> Lord <hi>Jermyn,</hi> and his Heirs for ever.</p>
            <p>Then it Enacts, That the firſt Rector, after ſuch Deceaſe or Vacancy, ſhall be preſented or collated by the Biſhop of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> for the time being; and the next to ſucceed him, ſhall be preſented by the Lord <hi>Jermyn</hi> and his Heirs, and the two next ſucceeding turns by the Biſhop and his Succeſſors, and the next turn to the Lord <hi>Jermyn</hi> and his Heirs, and then the like Succeſſion of two turns for one to the Biſhop and his Succeſſion, and of one turn to the Lord <hi>Jermyn</hi> and his Heirs, for ever after. This is the Act.</p>
            <p>Now 'tis to be conſidered, That this Law doth bind the King, and would bind him in point of Intereſt, if he had been Patron of St. <hi>Martins</hi> in Right of his Crown; and if a Right or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of the Crown ſhall be bound by an Act of Parliament, a Prerogative ſhall be in no better plight. It cannot be ſaid, That he ſhall not be obliged by it, becauſe not named; for tho', and where he is not named, he is bound by Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of Statutes, according to the 5 <hi>Rep.</hi> 14 and 11 <hi>Rep.</hi> 68. He is bound by all Acts generally ſpeaking, which are to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent a Decay of Religion; and ſo he is bound by Acts, which are for further Relief, or to give a more ſpeedy Remedy againſt Wrong.</p>
            <p>It is no Objection, that this Law is in the Affirmative; for that it is introductive of a new Law in the very Subject, that is created <hi>de novo.</hi> Then before this Act the King had no Right over this; and if he hath now any over it, he can only have it, how, when, and as the Act gives it, not contrary to it; then the Biſhop was Patron of the Place out of which the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh is created: And the Biſhop can claim no other Right, than what the Act gives him, <hi>Bro. tit. Remitter</hi> 49. 'tis ſo agreed 1 <hi>Rep.</hi> 48. and in 2 <hi>Rep.</hi> 46. if Lands be given in Fee to one who was Tenant in Tayle, his Iſſue ſhall not be remitted, becauſe the latter Act takes away the force of the Statute <hi>de donis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Suppoſe he had been Enacted to be Patron of a Living, to which he had a former Right, there could be no Remitter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe as to particulars the Act is like a Judgment, and eſtops all Parties to claim any thing otherwiſe than according to the Act; and yet Remitter is a Title favoured in the Law, then if he have this only by force of this New Act, and another Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſhould preſent in his turn ſo given, 'twould be an Injury, if a Subject did it, and conſequently the King cannot do it; for the Prerogative which this Act gives, or which the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law gives, is not yet come to take place.</p>
            <pb n="175" facs="tcp:50172:94"/>
            <p>Tho' this be an Affirmative Law, yet according to the Rule taken and agreed in <hi>Slade</hi>'s and <hi>Drake</hi>'s Caſe, <hi>Hob.</hi> 298. being introductive or creative of a new thing, implies a Negative of all that is not in the purview, and many Caſes are there put to this purpoſe.</p>
            <p>Then alſo it being particular and expreſs, it implies a Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, becauſe this and the other are inconſiſtent;</p>
            <p>But Firſt, 'Tis obſervable all Preſcriptions and Cuſtoms are fore-cloſed by a New Act of Parliament, unleſs ſaved. Suppoſe there was an Act of Parliament in Force before this, <hi>viz.</hi> That the King ſhould preſent; yet another Statute Enacting ſomewhat new and inconſiſtent, will carry a Negative; and if ſo, in Caſe of a former Act, there's almoſt as much Reaſon for a Prerogative: It muſt be agreed, That a Man may preſcribe or alledge a Cuſtom againſt an Act of Parliament, when his Preſcription or Cuſtom is ſaved or preſerved by that or another Act; but regularly a Man cannot preſcribe or alledge a Cuſtom againſt any Act of Parliament, becauſe 'tis matter of Record, and the higheſt and greateſt Record which we know of in the Law, 1 <hi>Inſt.</hi> 115.</p>
            <p>Suppoſe Money were by the Law payable annually, and an Act comes and ſays it ſhall be paid Quarterly, by even and equal Portions at the four Feaſts, for the firſt Year, this will certainly alter the Law: 'Tis true,</p>
            <p>That a conſiſtent Devife or Statute, is no Repeal or Revoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but if a new Act gives a new Eſtate different from the former, this amounts to a Repeal, <hi>Fox</hi> and <hi>Harcourt</hi>'s Caſe.</p>
            <p>The ſame Rule holds even in Caſe of the King as in the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi>'s Caſe, 2 <hi>Rep.</hi> 46. and agreed to in <hi>Hob.</hi> 310. the Query was, if the Lands came to the King by 31 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 13. or by the Stat. of <hi>Edw.</hi> 6. and objected, That the latter was in the Affirmative; yet held, That it came by the latter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe tho' they were Affirmative Words, yet they were diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently penn'd; and the laſt being of as high an Authority as the firſt, and providing by expreſs Words, That by Authority of that Parliament they ſhould be in actual Poſſeſſion of the King, held that they ſhould be in him by force of that laſt Act; and Reaſon will warrant theſe Differences, becauſe if otherwiſe, Inconſiſtencies and Contradictions muſt be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed.</p>
            <p>Then this is a new Law in the whole; 'tis a new Pariſh, 'tis a new Advowſon; and in truth 'tis no Advowſon till the Avoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance; nay, by the words of the Act (if any difference can be in an inſtant, between, at and after, as our Law in ſeveral Caſes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows it, as <hi>per mortem &amp; post mortem,</hi> Deviſe by Jointenant, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) there's no Patronage fixed, 'tis no Advowſon until after the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidance; for ſo are the words; after the Avoidance, the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowſon,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:50172:95"/>Patronage, and Preſentation ſhall be veſted, <hi>foret veſtit' in Epiſcopo</hi> Lond' <hi>&amp; Domino</hi> Jermyn, and till then 'tis veſted in no Body; and that which is in no Body, is not at all; unleſs it be, as ſome times for neceſſity ſake we ſay, <hi>in nubibus,</hi> or <hi>in abeyance;</hi> but to ſay that an Advowſon ſhall be in abeyance, before 'tis created or ordained to exiſt or be at all, muſt favour ſomewhat of Abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity: Now the King can have no Prerogative turn upon an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidance, by a Promotion, but when the Patron's Clerk was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted and preferred; and here is no Patron till that Avoidance happen. They ſay 'tis veſted immediately, tho' to take poſſeſſion hereafter, as a Reverſion granted <hi>cum acciderit,</hi> according to 3 <hi>Cro.</hi> 323. and 1 <hi>Saund.</hi> 147. But that's not this Caſe; for there is a preſent Grant; here the words are, <hi>After the Avoidance ſhall be veſted, and not before;</hi> and being a new thing it may be ſo; as a Rent-charge <hi>de novo</hi> may be granted to take effect <hi>de futuro,</hi> but cannot be ſo of an old Rent.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Dr. <hi>Tenniſon</hi> comes not in by the Patron's Preſentation, but by Donation of the Parliament; and there is not any Preſident for a Prerogative to preſent to a Donative upon a Promotion: The King cannot preſent to that, which the Patron could not have preſented to: and the Patron could not preſent to a Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, <hi>quatenus</hi> a Donative; and for the King to preſent to a Donative, is to injure the Patron; for 'tis to make that Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentative, which was never intended by the Patron to be ſo: And yet in Caſe of a Donative with Cure of Souls (as it may be of a Parochial Church, tho' exempt from Ordinary's Juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, according to <hi>Yelverton</hi> 61. 2 <hi>Roll. Abridg.</hi> 341.) the Ordinary may compel the Patron to Collate ſome body, as was held in Caſe of the Rectory Parochial Donative of St. <hi>Burian</hi>'s in <hi>Cornwall;</hi> and the <hi>Tower</hi> of <hi>London</hi> is with Cure of Souls, 1 <hi>Cro.</hi> 330. 2 <hi>Roll. Abridg.</hi> 331. 1 <hi>Inſt.</hi> 144. The ſame will be void by a Promotion of the Incumbent; for 'tis not meerly the change of Inferiour into Superiour that makes the Avoidance; for then an Incumbent, made Biſhop of another Dioceſs, or in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> would not avoid the Benefice; but 'tis the Doubleneſs of the Charge, contrary to the Council of <hi>Lateran,</hi> which hath been received here. This is more different from the pretended Notion and Reaſon of this Prerogative, then that Caſe of a Common Donative; for in Caſe of a Donative, there's an Incumbent of the Patron's own preferring, who is further promoted by the King, and ſtill in being, and the ſame Patron claiming a Right to fill the ſame: Here 'tis an Incumbency by Gift of the King, Lords and Commons. And then, if it be conſidered what this new Prerogative is, for ſo it muſt be termed, ſince there's no foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteps for it in the old times, and the Statute of <hi>Prerogativa Regis</hi> (which enumerates moſt of them, and is rather a Collection of old Prerogatives then a new Statute) mentions it not; 'tis a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative to preſent upon the Promotion of the Patron's Preſentee, or incumbent preſented in his Right; here is no ſuch thing; 'tis
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:50172:95"/>as their Books ſay, when the Patron's Preſentee is advanced to a greater Dignity in the Church; and the pretended Reaſon given for it to avoid the Objection, That no Prerogative is to be inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, or to import a Wrong done to the Subject, is this, That here's no Injury to the Patron, but a Kindneſs to his Friend, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Perſon which he choſe and preferred is bettered, and further preferred to an higher Degree of Honour and State in the Church; all this fails here; ſo that there doth not ſeem to be the ſame Colour, why the King ſhould have it in this Caſe.</p>
            <p>It is a good Argument, according to Mr. <hi>Littleton,</hi> That becauſe no ſuch ever was before, that therefore of right it ought not to be: And if no Practiſe hath been to warrant it, in Caſe of a Gift by Act of Parliament, there's no reaſon it ſhould be allowed in this Caſe; for a Prerogative never uſed, can never be with Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety called a Prerogative; much leſs reaſon have they for it, if they have no Practiſe or preſidents to warrant their Claim in caſe of any Donative.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Prima facie</hi> the patron hath the right; to evade that right of his Mr. Attorney pretends to a Prerogative; then it being of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon right with him, they ought to demonſtrate that there is ſuch a Prerogative to controul that right in this particular Caſe, and the Arguments brought for it ought to be clear, convincing, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted: Now becauſe where a Patron's Preſentee is preferred by being conſecrated a Biſhop, the King ſhall preſent, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore where the Parliament's Preſentee is preferred, the Patron ſhall loſe the benefit of his Preſentation, is a <hi>non ſequitur,</hi> becauſe the Caſes are not the ſame; for the ſuppoſed Recompence or Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration in the one, holds not in the other: This is not the Caſe of a Prerogative incident to the Crown, from the Neceſſity of Government, nor is it a Prerogative which reſpects the Continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance or Improvement of the Revenue, ſo as for the benefit of the Kingdom, an Extent or Enlargement of it beyond former Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe, may ſeem abſolutely needful; and therefore the common pretences of Intendment and Preſumption, are no more on their ſide then upon this; nay, 'tis rather otherwiſe, becauſe that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon right is with the Patron.</p>
            <p>It is no Objection to ſay, That there never was ſuch a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion or Avoidance before; whether there were, or not, is not material; but that rather turns upon them, for that Evinces be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond diſpute, that there never was ſuch a Prerogative preſentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in Fact as they now contend for; <hi>Argument' à ſimili</hi> is the weakeſt, but they have no Caſe like this; nay, they have no O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion in the Books declaring on their ſide; nay, the Book De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition of this Prerogative, as was ſaid before, is only to preſent to a Benefice, vacant by promotion, that was antecedently pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentable; here the whole Kingdom is Patron, and all that they can pretend to, is when a Man is dignified by promotion, who came in by Preſentation or Collation, and not otherwiſe.</p>
            <pb n="178" facs="tcp:50172:96"/>
            <p>It is not at preſent proper to argue when this Prerogative ſhall begin or commence upon this Church, or if ever; 'twill be time enough to diſpute that, when another Occaſion offers it ſelf, when the Doctor, or any of his Succeſſors, happens to be preferred to the ſame ſtate, as his Predeceſſor is. It ſuffices to maintain that this turn belongs to the Biſhop of <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is not an Advowſon created, as others uſually are. Firſt, As was obſerved before, no Advowſon is fixed, or veſted, or crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but <hi>in futuro,</hi> the ſame Perſon is made a Pluraliſt by Act of Parliament, tho' the Act it ſelf ſays the Pariſh was too great for one Cure.</p>
            <p>Then 'twas obſerved, That this is not a Patronage turn; it muſt be admitted that this Act veſts the Fee-ſimple of this Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowſon in the Lord <hi>Jermyn</hi> and the Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> and in their reſpective Heirs and Succeſſors by turns, <hi>viz.</hi> to the Lord <hi>Jermyn</hi> one, and to the Biſhop two ſucceſſively; and ſo the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion is enacted to be for ever; now this is not one of thoſe Patronage ſucceſſive turns, but it is a particular Preſentation which is given to the Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> by expreſs Limitation, and the penning is different. The firſt, about which the preſent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt is, is to be by the Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> for the time being; then the ſucceſſive Preſentations of one and two, are to be, one by the Lord and his Heirs, and the two by the Biſhop and his Succeſſors; ſo that there is no words in the firſt that looks like the Gift of an Eſtate, but 'tis only one firſt particular Preſentation, given to the Biſhop more then ordinary: It is not one of his turns, which he is to have as Patron, by two to one: But firſt he is to preſent one, before ever it comes into the form and manner of turns pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by this Act, in perpetual Succeſſion: For if otherwiſe, the Patronage would be to the Biſhop three turns in four, to one of the Lord <hi>Jermyns.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to their Objection, That a Patronage newly created ſhall be in the ſame plight, and under the ſame Rules and Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances and Incumbrances as another; that Objection can never take place, before it becomes a Patronage, which this was not: And 2. with a ſtronger reaſon, it can never take place, till it hath been preſented unto: 3. It can never take place, where a particular Preſentation is at firſt given by expreſs words.</p>
            <p>The words are, <hi>The first Rector ſhall be Collated by the Biſhop for the time being, and then the Succeſſion;</hi> and it is always to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred that 'tis an Act of Parliament. Now ſuppoſe the Act had ſaid that the Patronage, after an Avoidance, ſhould be veſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>A.</hi> and <hi>B.</hi> but that the firſt Rector, upon that Avoidance, ſhould be preſented by <hi>J. S.</hi> a third Perſon; this could never be reckoned a common ordinary turn, ſubject to the like Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive as others: The Biſhop here claims not this particular Preſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in right of his Patronage, whereby he is to have two turns to one; but by expreſs Gift of the Parliament.</p>
            <pb n="179" facs="tcp:50172:96"/>
            <p>Suppoſe the King had been Patron of St. <hi>Martyns</hi> in his own right, no Man would ſay, that this Act, thus creating of a new Pariſh, a new Rectory, and a new Patron, would not have bound him.</p>
            <p>Surely the King's Aſſent as Supream or General Patron, is as much implied in this Act, as it would have been, had he been a particular Patron of the Church of that Pariſh, out of which the new one is taken: Here the King himſelf gives the firſt Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation to the Biſhop of <hi>London;</hi> for the King and People, all together, the whole Kingdom are Donors or Grantors of this firſt Preſentation to my Lord of <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Suppoſe ſuch a Right as this is, were in a Subject, and he were able to preſcribe for it, he muſt then have ſet forth, that time out of mind, whereſoever any incumbent of anothers Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation was preferr'd by him to another Living, that he ſhould have the Preſentation <hi>ea vice;</hi> this is the moſt that could be made of it. Would any Man ſay, That this Caſe would fall under that Preſcription, or the reaſon of it. Now tho' a Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative be part of the Common Law, and not like a Preſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; yet every Prerogative hath its Boundaries and its Limits, and a Reaſon for it too; or elſe 'tis no Prerogative, that our Law allows of.</p>
            <p>Beſides, there's good Reaſon in Fact, for this Proviſion of the firſt Preſentation, becauſe the Act takes notice of the Pariſh of St. <hi>Martyns;</hi> out of which, this Pariſh is taken, and the Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> was Patron thereof, and at firſt there's the ſame In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent of both, Dr. <hi>Tenniſon:</hi> Now the Patronage being formerly in the Biſhop, and in the Succeſſive Patronage, crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of this new Church by this Act, there's one turn in three given away from him to a third Perſon, then this Preſentation out of turn is at firſt given to the Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the third turn given to the Lord <hi>Jermyn</hi> afterwards.</p>
            <p>Then there's another thing deſerving of notice in this Caſe, and that's this; That one and the ſame Perſon being incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent of both Pariſhes, the King hath had the Effect of his Prerogative upon the promotion of this very Incumbent, by preſenting to that Church, into which he came by Preſentation and Induction, <hi>viz.</hi> St. <hi>Martyns;</hi> but here the Prerogative can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not operate, becauſe he came into this by Donation, not of the Patron, but of the Parliament; and conſequently as was ſaid before, of the King himſelf.</p>
            <p>Beſides, here's no Salvoe of the King's Prerogative, or other Right; and to what end in all private Acts for Sale of Eſtates, paying of Debts, docking of Settlements, and the like; do the King's Council take Care, always to inſert a ſaving, if the ſame be not neceſſary.</p>
            <p>Here's a new Eſtate given, and that to a particular Perſon, and in a particular manner; and no Perſon can claim a Right to, in, or over this, but as the Parliament hath given it; as for
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:50172:97"/>inſtance, in an Act where two Churches are united, as upon the Rebuilding of the City of <hi>London,</hi> the firſt Preſentation is ordered to be by the Patron of the Living, of the greateſt Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue in the King's Books. The King is Patron of the Living of the leſſer Value, as he is of ſeveral of them in <hi>London,</hi> he ſhall not have his Common Prerogative of the firſt Preſentation, which he hath in all other Caſes, where his Intereſt is intermixed with others, as in Caſe of Coparceners; and the youngeſt is in Ward, he ſhall preſent firſt; tho' the eldeſt, by the Common Law, is to have the firſt turn, and the King's Right is in the Place of the youngeſt; but yet in caſe where that an Act of Parliament gives a new Eſtate, and preſcribes a Method, tho' in the Affirmative, the Method limited ſhall take place againſt the King's Prerogative of being preferr'd; and the reaſon is, becauſe it is a new Right which the Act gave to preſent to the Church, to which the Union was, and conſequently it muſt be taken as 'tis given: And ſo was it held by the <hi>Civilians</hi> at <hi>Doctors Commons,</hi> before the Chancellour of <hi>London,</hi> and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral aſſiſtant Delegates, upon a <hi>Caveat</hi> there againſt Inſtitution, and on Advice of the Lawyers, the King's Preſentee acquieſced, and never brought any <hi>Quare Impedit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Argument now is only, as to this one firſt Preſentation, there's no flat Contradiction between the uſe of the Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and My being Patron for ever; but 'tis a Contradiction, to ſay, the King and I ſhall both have the ſame Preſentation.</p>
            <p>To ſay, That he ſhall have a Prerogative here, is to ſay, That he ſhall do a wrong to his Subject, for the Biſhop can have no other than this one Preſentation; he can have no other in lieu of it, and has no Advantage or Recompence antecedent or ſubſequent from this Prerogative.</p>
            <p>Firſt-Fruits and Tenths are not demandable from this Pariſh, becauſe no ſaving of them in the Act to the King; upon paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Act, 'tis known, That in the Commons Houſe the ſame was preſs'd to be inſerted, but denied, and the Clauſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected; the ſame Attempt was made in this Houſe, but to no purpoſe.</p>
            <p>In other Acts for the Erecting of new Pariſhes, there is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally ſuch a ſaving, as for St. <hi>Ann</hi>'s, and St. <hi>John</hi>'s of <hi>Wap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping,</hi> and the Act for uniting of Pariſhes, upon Rebuilding the City, hath a Clauſe of ſaving to this Effect: All which ſhews, That ſuch a ſaving is neceſſary, tho' the Firſt-Fruits and Tenths being formerly enjoyed by the Popes, might have been pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by Conſtruction of Law, to be a Profit annexed to the Crown by Stat. of 26 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 1. all Payments to the Pope having been prohibited by 25 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 21. and all Profits and Commodities enjoyed by the Popes thereby annexed to the Crown. Yet neither that Act, nor that other in the ſame Year (whereby the Firſt-Fruits and Tenths of all Eccleſiaſtical Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:50172:97"/>that then, or thereafter ſhould belong from any Parſonage or Vicarage were granted to the Crown) were ever intended to reach this Pariſh of St. <hi>James</hi>'s, it being a new Creation by Act of Parliament; and becauſe in the Act no Firſt-Fruits or Tenths are given or ſaved; and there's as much Reaſon to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue in that caſe, for an implied ſaving, as there is for this Prerogative.</p>
            <p>Suppoſe it ſhould be admitted, That a preſentable Benefice created by Act of Parliament, ſhould be ſubject to the ſame Rules as others are; yet that will not reach this, becauſe not like other Benefices till once preſented to; 'tis a peculiar ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Caſe, by 2 <hi>Roll. abr.</hi> 342. and 1 <hi>Inſt.</hi> 344. If a Patron pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to a Donative, it becomes preſentative ever after; which ſhews, That 'tis the Preſentation which makes it preſentative in its Nature, now here 'tis plainly a Donative till once pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to.</p>
            <p>Then it was ſaid, That it is not needful to engage in the Diſpute, whether this Prerogative ſhall prevail againſt the Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee of the next Avoidance, according to <hi>Woodley</hi>'s Caſe, 2 <hi>Cro.</hi> 695. or whether that caſe be Law, for that the ſame is plainly diſtinguiſhable from our Caſe, for there the Grantee comes in the place of the Grantor, <hi>quoad</hi> that Avoidance, and he can have no better or greater Right than his Grantor would have had, if no ſuch Grant had been made. Here ours is a firſt Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation, granted by Act of Parliament.</p>
            <p>Suppoſe the Donors of this Preſentation to the Biſhop, had named a Perſon <hi>in Eſſe,</hi> to have ſucceeded upon the Death or A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidance of Dr. <hi>Tenniſon;</hi> no Man will pretend that this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative ſhould have prevented him, the reaſon given in the Books cited for that Caſe of the Grantee of the next Avoidance, is, That the Patron could not grant more or otherwiſe, than under the Contingency of this Prerogative. Surely they will not ſay, That the King, Lords, and Commons, were ſuch fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble qualified, reſtrained Donors; then the Parliament being the Donors, the Prerogative inſiſted upon, and the expreſs Gift to the Biſhop, are contradictory and repugnant, and cannot both be fulfilled.</p>
            <p>It is no Argument to ſay, That if a Vacancy had been in the See, and the Temporalties in the King's hands, then the King muſt have preſented and not the Biſhop, and that would have contradicted the Act as much as this; for that had been the ſame as if the Biſhop had preſented himſelf, for the King during that time, was in <hi>loco ordinarij.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To ſay, That the Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> hath no more right by the Act of Parliament, then a Grantee of the next Avoidance hath by the Common Law, this ſurely is no very cloſe reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, for there is ſome difference between the one and the other: Here the Act of Parliament (which hath the King's Conſent)
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:50172:98"/>gives a particular and expreſs Right, and an Act of Parliament may (as <hi>Coke</hi> ſaith) alter, change, annul, abridge, diminiſh, qualifie, enlarge or transferr any Common Law; nay, it hath the Common Law and the Prerogative too, under its Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul.</p>
            <p>Upon the whole, it was concluded, That by this Judgment, a new Prerogative is affirm'd to belong to the Crown, and this is extended to a turn after a <hi>Commendam,</hi> which may be a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice to all the Patrons in <hi>England;</hi> 2. It deſtroys and makes uſeleſs the plain and expreſs Words and Meaning of the Act of Parliament, which gives the firſt Preſentation to the Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> and 3. It confirms the old <hi>Non obſtante</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of <hi>Commendams,</hi> which hath always been acknowledged to be to the prejudice of the Church; wherefore it was prayed, That the ſaid Judgment might be revers'd.</p>
            <p>On the other ſide it was argued, That this Judgment ought to be affirmed; for that, as to the firſt pont, tho' it hath been ſaid to be a new thing, and grounded upon late Preſidents, yet it hath been ſo often adjudged, that it doth not now deſerve a Debate; 'twas ſolemnly ſettled in <hi>Wright</hi>'s Caſe, and upon Conſideration, 2 <hi>Rolls Abridg.</hi> 343, 344. 3 <hi>Cro.</hi> 526. <hi>Moore</hi> 399. That tho' many ancient Authorities have been loſt, yet in <hi>Brooke, Preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment al Eſgliſe</hi> 61. there is the Opinion of the Biſhop of <hi>Ely</hi> for it. And as to the old Preſidents, there's no need of Recourſe to them, becauſe continual Uſage hath been with the King in this matter; a ſettled Opinion for an hundred years is ſurely enough to declare the Law as to this particular: This is ſufficient Evidence to prove this Right in the Crown, there being no Judicial Opinion againſt it. The reaſon for this Prerogative, is becauſe the King, by the exerciſe of his prerogative in the promotion, hath made the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidance, and it is but changing one Life for another, and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly the Patron is as near the having another preſentation, as before.</p>
            <p>It was agreed that this is none of the prerogatives mentioned in the Statute <hi>de Prerogativa Regis;</hi> but then 'twas ſaid, That the prerogative to preſent by Lapſe, is not in the Statute, and yet that is admitted; ſo that the omiſſion of it there, can be no ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection; this is a prerogative that follows a Vacancy occaſioned by the exerciſe of the prerogative, for ſuch it is to make Biſhops. The King firſt made them by the donation of a Ring and Staff, then by a <hi>Conge d'Eſlier,</hi> the King gave licence to chooſe, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved the perſon choſen, tho' not by abſolute donation, as before. By the 25 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. the Crown is reſtored to its ancient Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, and there are Letters Miſſive, directing the choice of ſuch a perſon. In <hi>Wright</hi>'s Caſe in 3 <hi>Cro.</hi> and <hi>Moore,</hi> then was the firſt time it came in queſtion; and it was debated and conſidered, and the Judgment upon deliberation ſettled it with the King. And as to the Objection, that in <hi>Dyer</hi> 228. 'tis ſaid, That he and the reſt
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:50172:98"/>of his Brethren thought otherwiſe; that point was nothing to the Caſe then in queſtion: But however, 'tis obſervable that the Queen preſented <hi>Anno</hi> 6. and the Patron did not diſpute it, as appears in <hi>Woodly</hi>'s Caſe. And in <hi>Owen</hi>'s <hi>Rep.</hi> 'tis ſaid, that ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Preſidents in <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth's time were ſearched. 'Tis true, that in 11 <hi>Hen.</hi> 4.67. and 21 <hi>Edw.</hi> 4.33. the King did not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>title himſelf by virtue of his Prerogative, but by reaſon of the Temporalties being in his hands; thoſe Caſes can influence no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in this matter, becauſe the King's Prerogative conſiſts not in ouſting of himſelf, but of a Stranger; it is to preſent in the turn of another upon ſuch a Vacancy, but not where he is intituled himſelf, there he preſents by virtue of his own Intereſt.</p>
            <p>As to the Objection, That the Old Books are ſilent about this Prerogative; 'twas anſwer'd, That before the Statute of <hi>Proviſors</hi> 25 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. the King was defeated of his Prerogative by reaſon of the Pope's Proviſions, and therefore the King could not have it; whereas 'tis the Exerciſe of his Prerogative of Promotion, that gives him this Prerogative of preſenting upon this Vacancy by ſuch Promotion; and therefore that Statute was made to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent all Incroachments; and tho' it was made to that very pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, yet the Clergy being then ſo ſtrongly united to the Pope's Intereſt, the Kings of <hi>England</hi> could not uſe that Prerogative, and frequent Uſurpations were made upon the Crown, till the Pope's Supremacy was denied. The 41 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3.5. ſhews that there were ſuch Uſurpations. 7 <hi>Hen.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 8. complaint is made of them: and 5 <hi>Hen.</hi> 4. <hi>num.</hi> 95. <hi>Cotton.</hi> 458. And thus it continued till the Statute about the Supremacy 28 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. the Kings are to make the Biſhops; and then conſequently, in point of Law, the right of preſenting was reſtored.</p>
            <p>Then 'twas urged, That none of the old Books do mention the King's right to preſent by Lapſe, except in <hi>Cawdries</hi> Caſe, where notice is taken of a Caſe in the time of <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. but that is not to be found. <hi>Bro. tit. Preſentment</hi> 61. is as much Authority for this as that in <hi>Cawdries</hi> Caſe is, for the Prerogative to preſent upon Lapſe. And this right in queſtion, having been enjoyed ſo long, ſhould not now have been queſtioned.</p>
            <p>In 5 <hi>Edw.</hi> 2. <hi>Maynard</hi> 148, 198. there is one Inſtance of the Patron's preſenting again; but then Proviſions were common and uſual, <hi>Walſingham</hi> 1313. ſo that ſuppoſing the Patron did in thoſe times preſent, the King was not concerned, becauſe 'twas then only the Pope's right, as was thought, and the Pope might be ignorant of the matter. And from thence 'twas argued, that the practiſe of thoſe Times cannot be urged as Arguments in the preſent Caſe.</p>
            <p>Then 2. it was urged, That the King having this Prerogative, he is not debarred of it by the Diſpenſation to hold it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> nor by the Act of Parliament, nor by the King's Confirmation of it. The King by that did transfer no Right to the Incumbent, but
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:50172:99"/>meerly did continue him in, and there was no Avoidance, but the ſame is ſuſpended; and had the Incumbent died, or reſigned, during this time, the Church had been void by ſuch Death or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation, and had debarred the King of his Prerogative: The Incumbent ſtill remains Incumbent for the time, by force of his firſt preſentation, and ſo the Diſpenſation doth prevent the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidance: He is not in by force of any Title which the Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation gives him, but of his old Title, <hi>Jones</hi> 91. 161. <hi>Vaughan</hi> 18.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Then 'twas argued that the Act of Parliament for making this new Pariſh did not alter the Caſe. 'Twas ſaid, that the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of this a Rectory in this manner, doth make it ſubject to this prerogative; and that it was by no means the intent of the Act to debar the prerogative. It is made a Pariſh and Rectory, ſuch as others are, ſubject to the EccleſiaſticalLaws, as well as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Benefice, under the obligation to Reſidence, and liable to the Common Juriſdiction and Cenſure of the Ordinary; and 'tis to be made vacant by the ſame ways and means, as other livings are; the words <hi>Death, or any other Avoidance,</hi> prove it to be ſo: Lapſe will prevail upon this Rectory; and that cannot be, but becauſe 'tis made a Rectory, and preſentative. It cannot be doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but that the next Avoidance might have been granted over by the Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> before any Avoidance was.</p>
            <p>Suppoſe the Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> had died, and this Promotion had happened, ſhould not the King have preſented by reaſon of the Temporalties; and yet that is as much out of the Words of the Act, as this is? As to its being a Donative, 'twas ſaid, That the preſent Rector doth not come in by Donation; and tho' 'tis true, That the King cannot preſent to a Donative upon ſuch an occaſion, the reaſon is, becauſe the Promotion doth not make a Vacancy of the Donative, it doth not make a Ceſſion, the Parſon is not ſubject to Cenſures as other Rectors are; he is ſtill in by reaſon of the Inſtitution of the Founder, ſo that nothing can be inferr'd from thence: Suppoſe the Incumbency of a Donative had been immediately turned into a Rectory, would not that have ſubjected it to this Prerogative: 'Tis ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, That the promotion of the Rector did make an Avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; then was cited <hi>Princes</hi> Caſe, 8 <hi>Rep.</hi> Then ſuppoſe it a Donative as to Dr. <hi>Tenniſon,</hi> at the ſame time that the Church becomes vacant, the Patronage veſts; and then the King's Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative ſhall take place, either <hi>codem Inſtanti,</hi> or before: But here the Right of Patronage did veſt immediately by the Act; he that is to preſent when the Rectory becomes void, he is Patron: 'Tis like a Reverſion granted <hi>cum acciderit,</hi> there is a preſent Intereſt veſted; and there's no reaſon why it ſhould not be ſo, in Caſe of this Act of Parliament.</p>
            <p>The Stat. of 12 <hi>Car.</hi> 2. for confirming of Livings, makes the then Poſſeſſors full and perfect Incumbents, as this doth, were not theſe Benefices void, if the Parties were advanced to Biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricks,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:50172:99"/>and upon ſuch promotions, did not the King preſent, undoubtedly he did.</p>
            <p>Then 'twas argued, That 'twas never the Intent of this Act to ouſt the King of this Prerogative; the firſt Intent was to make a Pariſh, and eſtabliſh a Rectory, that was the true deſign. Suppoſe the Act had only veſted the Advowſon in my Lord of <hi>London,</hi> and had not mentioned the Lord <hi>Jermyn,</hi> would not this Prerogative have been conſiſtent with the Right of Patron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age: As to the pretence that the Biſhop is to preſent firſt, that is only to make a Partition; 'tis an Explanation, That they ſhould not have it in common, but by turns. The holding of Dr. <hi>Tenniſon</hi> was reckoned as one turn, and the Biſhop was to have the next; beſides, every Act of Parliament is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrued according to the Subject Matter, and not further than the Act deſigns and intends; 'tis plain, from the Nature of the thing, That nothing was deſigned but to ſettle the Rectory, and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh the manner of Preſentation, according to the Agreement of the parties: General Words ſhall not ouſt the King of his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative, ſince he is not named, 3 <hi>Cor.</hi> 542. <hi>Moor</hi> 540.7 <hi>Rep.</hi> 32. <hi>Plowd.</hi> 240. <hi>Hob.</hi> 146. Here are no Words which do im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port any Intention to reſtrain the King of that Right with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to this, as he hath with reſpect to other Rectories. The King's Prerogative doth not interfere with their being two Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes; this Prerogative muſt operate upon all preſentative Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings, ſo ſoon as they are made ſo.</p>
            <p>This can never be pretended to be partly preſentative and partly donative; for Dr. <hi>Tenniſon</hi> was in by Act of Parliament as one preſented: Then it being a Ceſſion of a preſentative Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory, whether old or new, 'tis the King's Right to preſent. <hi>Vernon</hi>'s Caſe, 4 <hi>Rep.</hi> 4. <hi>Plowd.</hi> 127. The Dr. came in not by Donation, but was rather placed in by Parliament, which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies in it the Conſent, and all the neceſſary Acts of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron and Ordinary: Suppoſe the King ſhould grant away his own Advowſon during a Plenarty, and afterwards ſuch a Ceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhould happen by promotion; ſurely that would not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive the King of his prerogative, and by the ſame Reaſon it ought not in this Caſe. Wherefore, upon the whole Matter, it was prayed, That the Judgment ſhould be affirmed, and it was affirmed accordingly.</p>

            </p>
            <p>And now it was argued on the behalf of the King, That this Reverſal was not juſtifiable; that the Exceptions taken be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low were many, and as to the Pretence that <hi>ſecreta membra am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putentur</hi> was omitted; the ſame was not allowed as Error below, by reaſon of the many Precedents which in the Entries did omit it. That tho' the Practice be common to pronounce it, yet few or no ancient Records do mention it; that in 3 <hi>Inst.</hi> 210. where the Judgment is taken notice of, this is not part <hi>In Plowd.</hi> 387. 'tis omitted, that <hi>Interiora</hi> includes it, <hi>In Bro coron'</hi> 128. 'tis not inſerted; That this was never entred as part of the Judgment, till 12 <hi>Car.</hi> 2. Then as to the <hi>ſeparatim allocut'</hi> upon the Arraignment, that was likewiſe over-rul'd below; for it muſt be intended a ſeveral Demand or Queſtion: And the ſame is implied in this Entry, as much as if it had been expreſs'd, and the Precedents are both ways. But the main and only Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for which the Court revers'd the Judgment, was, That in the Indictment, 'tis not ſaid to be a Fact done <hi>contra ligeantie ſue debitum;</hi> and as to this, it was argued, That it was not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to uſe thoſe very Words, That they are not Terms of Art, ſuch as are abſolutely neceſſary; they are not like to the Words <hi>Burglariter, Felonice, Murdravit,</hi> and the like; That <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditorie</hi> implies it, that 'tis plainly apparent to be contrary to his Allegiance; That all the whole Indictment ſhews it to be ſo, 'tis not weighing his Allegiance, 'tis againſt his true natural Liege, Lord and Sovereign, That it appears he was a natural born Subject; That the very Words themſelves are only of Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation, That they may as well be laid precedent to the Fact as in the Concluſion; That here is that which is Tantamount. That Sir <hi>Henry Vane</hi>'s Indictment was thus, <hi>Cotton</hi> and <hi>Meſſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, Sid.</hi> 328. The <hi>Scotch</hi> Officers in <hi>Suffolk, Lamberts, Hack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhams, Titchburns,</hi> and many more.</p>
            <p>That 'tis true, the Fact in the Indictment ought not to be made good by Intendment or Inference; but if there be Words which ſhew, that the Party owed Allegiance, its enough. An alien E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy is not indictable in this manner; but here 'tis ſhewn, That he is a Perſon capable of committing Treaſon, and that the Act done was againſt his Duty and Obedience which he owed as a Subject; That many Precedents have been thus, That <hi>nimia ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilitas in jure reprobatur;</hi> That a Certainty to a common Intent is ſufficient, <hi>Longs caſe;</hi> That in 2 <hi>Rolls. abr.</hi> 82. <hi>contra coron' et dignitat' ſuas,</hi> is held not neceſſary; wherefore, and for other Reaſons then urged, 'twas prayed, That the Reverſal might be reverſed, and the King reſtored, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="188" facs="tcp:50172:101"/>
            <p>On the other ſide, it was argued, That this Reverſal was juſt; That this Arraignment being Joint, for want of <hi>ſeparatim,</hi> makes the Proceeding Erroneous; That the Precedents do uſe the Word <hi>ſeparatim;</hi> and abundance of Entries were mentioned, as <hi>Leach</hi> and <hi>Ruthford, et al'.</hi> 28 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. <hi>Dudely, Gates,</hi> and <hi>Palmer,</hi> 1 and 2 <hi>Phil.</hi> and <hi>Mar'. Throgmorton</hi> and <hi>Weddall,</hi> 2 and 3 <hi>Ph.</hi> and <hi>M. Peckham</hi> and <hi>Daniel, eodem Anno. Blunt</hi> and <hi>Danverſe,</hi> 44. <hi>Eliz.</hi> Earl of <hi>Eſſ.</hi> and <hi>S. eodem Anno. Guy Fawks</hi> and Sir <hi>Everard Digby,</hi> 3 <hi>Jac.</hi> 1. <hi>Harriſon, Scot,</hi> and the other Regicides, 12 <hi>Car.</hi> 2. 1660. <hi>Green, Berry,</hi> and <hi>Hill,</hi> for the Murder of Sir. <hi>E.

Beſides, the Nature of the thing is ſuch, as requires a ſeveral Arraignment, becauſe they may plead ſeveral Pleas, and they are ſeveral Offences; and tho' they plead in this Caſe ſeverally, that's not enough; for they ought to be askt ſeverally:</p>
            <p>But this was not ſo much inſiſted on, as the next Error, the Omiſſion of <hi>ſecreta</hi> in the Judgment; 'tis part of the Judgment upon the 25 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. for compaſſing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> tho' for coining, 'tis only to be drawn and hanged, according to <hi>Morgan</hi>'s Caſe, <hi>Cro.

Rep</hi> 185, 186. there 'tis mentioned.</p>
            <p>But then it was chiefly inſiſted on, That the Reverſal was to be maintained for the Error in the Indictment; that <hi>contra lige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antie ſue debitum</hi> was the general Form; that all the great Men in all Ages, who had been of Counſel for the Crown, had inſerted it: That all the Indictments, the firſt Aſſizes, after <hi>Monmouth</hi>'s Rebellion, which were drawn or peruſed by Sir <hi>H. Poll'</hi> had this Concluſion: That <hi>Aſhtons, Croſſes, Gaunts, Corniſhes,</hi> Earl of <hi>Staffords, Batemans, Ayliffs, Goodenoughs, Hone, Blague, Rowſe, Armſtrong,</hi> Sir <hi>Robert Peyton, Langhornes,</hi> Lord <hi>Bellaſis, Venner, Harriſons, Faukes,</hi> Sir <hi>Everard Digbyes, Patricius Dolphie, Paſch.</hi> 41 <hi>Eliz.

<pb n="189" facs="tcp:50172:101"/>Entries</hi> 361. <hi>Cro. Car.</hi> 120, 122, 123. and a great number of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars more, which might be cited.</p>
            <p>Then 'twas urged that Reaſon doth require this, for that Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is puniſhable as a Breach of Allegiance; that that is the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Eſſence of Treaſon; that if the Fact be not alledged to be againſt his Allegiance, 'tis not Treaſon; that 'tis by reaſon of his Allegiance that he can commit Treaſon; and therefore 'tis, that an Alien Enemy, who was never protected, can't commit Treaſon, becauſe he owed no Allegiance: and there may be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Acts done, which look like a levying of War, without any Breach of Allegiance; and for that was quoted King <hi>John</hi>'s Charter made at <hi>Rumney Mead,</hi> 18 <hi>die Junii Anno Regni</hi> 17 <hi>Rot. Pat.</hi> 17. <hi>m.</hi> 13. a Tranſcript whereof is in <hi>Matthew Paris</hi> 245. <hi>Anno</hi> 1215. which Charter was ratified four times within nine years after.

That after <hi>Michaelmas,</hi> this King held a Parliament at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> wherein he confirmed and ratified, by his Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, all the Franchiſes and Liberties which were made and given by King <hi>John</hi> his Father. In the ſeventh year of his Reign, <hi>viz.</hi> the Sixteenth of his Age, he took the Government into his own Hands; and then the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> in open Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, doth mind him of the Oath ſworn in his Name by the Earl of <hi>Pembroke (Rectore Regis &amp; Regni)</hi> and others, at the Pacification between him and the <hi>Dauphin,</hi> that he would reſtore and confirm thoſe Liberties to his Subjects, for which the War broke out between his Father and the Barons. Then was quoted what <hi>Henry</hi> the Third promiſed, when he invited <hi>Henry de Lucy</hi> to come in to him, 1 <hi>Hen.</hi> 3. <hi>m.</hi> 16. which is in very ſtrange lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, if his Allegiance had been broken. Then was cited <hi>Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler</hi> 262. and <hi>Spelman verbo ligeantia;</hi> and <hi>Calvin</hi>'s Caſe, 7 <hi>Rep.</hi> expounding of that word: and the old <hi>Cuſtumer of Normandy, cap.</hi> 43. And the ſaid, and other Authorities, were inforced and amplified in ſuch manner, as is not fit to be remembred.</p>
            <p>Then 'twas urged, That as the Subject Matter of this Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment did require theſe words, ſo the Reaſon of the Law in other Caſes did warrant them to be neceſſary here: that <hi>vi &amp; armis</hi> was neceſſary, till the Statute of <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. made it needleſs: and 'twould be ſtrange, that an Indictment for a Treſpaſs, ſetting forth an Aſſault and Battery, with force of Arms, ſhould be ill for want of <hi>contra Pacem,</hi> and this ſhould be good, without <hi>contra ligean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie

            <p>Then 'twas ſaid that there were expreſs Authorities for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant; 3 <hi>Inſt.</hi> 11. that the Indictment of Treaſon concludes thus, 1 <hi>Inſt.</hi> 129. is the ſame, and <hi>Dyer</hi> 144. to the like effect. And what is ſaid in the Margin of the new <hi>Dyer,</hi> is very remarkable as to <hi>Mary</hi> Queen of <hi>Scotland: Calvin</hi>'s Caſe 7 <hi>Rep.</hi> 6. is full and expreſs, as to the reaſon of the thing; and it is founded upon the Difference, between an Alien Enemy and a Subject, <hi>Courteen</hi>'s Caſe, <hi>Hob.</hi> 271. <hi>Hobart</hi> is of Opinion, according to <hi>Calvin</hi>'s Caſe, that Indictment againſt Alien <hi>amie,</hi> it muſt conclude <hi>contra debi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum ligeantie ſue.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Beſides, here are no words which carry the ſame Senſe, or are equivalent to it; <hi>Proditorie</hi> doth imply a Treachery or Falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and that he might be guilty of, and yet not act contrary to his Allegiance; for at that rate every Breach of Truſt, as to the King, would be Treaſon: <hi>debitum ligeantie ſue minime pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derantes,</hi> is not ſufficient; for a Man may not weigh his Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and yet not act contrary to it: then <hi>contra naturalem Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minum ſuum ſupremum verum &amp; indubitat';</hi> thoſe words in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are not neceſſary, and anciently were not inſerted: In old time 'twas only <hi>contra Dominum Regem;</hi> and 'twill be hard to ſay, that the uſe of words unneceſſary ſhould ſupply what is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, and hath anciently been uſed. Thoſe words do only import, that the late King was King of the Place where the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant was born and lived; and cannot make it appear, that his Fact was contrary to the Laws of the Land, and the Duty of his Allegiance, as a Subject to him.</p>
            <p>Then ſuppoſing it not neceſſary in the Concluſion; for, as ſome Preſidents are in <hi>Weſt</hi>'s <hi>Symboleography,</hi> 'tis firſt, as <hi>contra ligeantie ſue debitum levavit guerram,</hi> yet it ought to be in the Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in one part or another. The formal Reaſon of the Facts being Treaſon, is becauſe 'tis againſt his Allegiance, and that ought to be expreſſed; all the other Expreſſions urged on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide, are at the moſt but Argumentative, and do not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly affirm the thing which is neceſſary to make the Offence.</p>
            <pb n="191" facs="tcp:50172:102"/>
            <p>As to the Preſidents which are the other way, they are but few; thoſe in the Reign of <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. and Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> they are upon particular Statutes; as for denying the Supremacy; taking Orders under the Pope, and the like; they are not <hi>contra ligean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam</hi> in the nature of the Offence, and there <hi>contra formam ſtatut'</hi> is enough: But no Anſwer can be given to the Caſe of <hi>Lopez</hi> in <hi>Calvin</hi>'s Caſe, where the Judges met and conſidered, how the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment ſhould be, and agreed to be <hi>contra ſupremum Dominum ſuum in</hi> Anglia; and the Concluſion to be <hi>contra ligeantie ſue debitum.</hi> Whereupon, for theſe and other Reaſons, it was prayed, that the Judgment of Reverſal given in the <hi>Kings Bench</hi> might be affirmed; and it was affirmed accordingly.</p>

            </head>
            <p>APpeal from a Decree of the Court of <hi>Exchequer:</hi> The Caſe was no more than this; The Pariſh of <hi>Yeovilton</hi> conſiſting much in Paſture Land, and the Reſpondent having been Rector thereof for Twenty years laſt paſt and upwards, and being intituled to the great and ſmall Tythes, and all other Dues within the ſaid Rectory, he did exhibit his Bill in that Court, againſt the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellant, <hi>Joſeph</hi> in his own right, and as Executor of <hi>Henry</hi> his Father, and againſt the other Appellant <hi>Samuel Nayle,</hi> for Agiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Tythes, for depaſturing and fatting their Oxen, and other unprofitable Cattle, within the ſaid Rectory, from the Year 1677. to the time of exhibiting his Bill, which was in <hi>Michaelmas</hi> Term 1692.</p>
            <p>The Appellant <hi>Joſeph Eaſtmond</hi> by his Anſwer admitted, that he had Aſſets ſufficient to anſwer the Plaintiffs Demands; and both of them admitted, that they and the Teſtator had fatted and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſtured divers Oxen yearly upon their Lands in the ſaid Pariſh, but ſaid, that ſome of them were firſt uſed to the Plough, and afterwards fatted when turned off from the Plough.</p>
            <p>The Court of <hi>Exchequer</hi> did thereupon, <hi>viz. May</hi> 26. 1696. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree Tythe Herbage to be paid for the Appellants and the Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors Oxen and unprofitable Cattle, not uſed for the Plough; and alſo for their Oxen and unprofitable Cattle uſed for the Plough, for and during the time they were grazed and fatted in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh for Sale, after they were turned off from the Plough. And now it was inſiſted on in favour of the Appeal, that the Decree was unjuſt; and then were quoted ſome Texts of Scripture a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout muzzling the Ox, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And alſo it was urged, That that part of the Decree concerning Oxen once uſed to the Plough, was erroneous; and there were cited all the Caſes in the Books for exemption of Plough-Cattle from Tythe Herbage, and that this was double Tything: And it was inſiſted on, that the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the thing was againſt it in this Caſe, becauſe the agiſtment of theſe Cattle, was neceſſary to ſuſtain that labour which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted the Grain, of which Tythe was paid; that this Priviledge extended to all ſuch Oxen as ever had been uſed to the Plough; that the exemption did continue after they were forborn to be uſed at the Plough; for there was the ſame reaſon to continue the exemption afterwards, as there could be to allow it during the Interval, when they do not draw the Plough. And for
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:50172:103"/>theſe and other Reaſons urged, 'twas prayed, That the Decree for Tythe <hi>quoad</hi> ſuch Cattle as ever had been uſed with the Plough, ſhould be reverſed.</p>
            <p>On the other ſide it was urged, That the ſaid Decree is agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Law, and ſupported by many Reſolutions in the Court of <hi>Exchequer,</hi> that there was a Reaſon for Tythe in this Caſe; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe theſe Cattle, tho' formerly uſed to the Plough, they ceaſed now to belong to it, and conſequently Tythes became due; that there's a Difference in the nature of the thing; for when they feed in order to labour, the Parſon hath a Tenth of the Benefit produced thereby, but when they are fatted only for Sale, 'tis otherwiſe; That this was a ſettled and allowed Difference in the <hi>Exchequer;</hi> That while the Oxen are working, no Tithe ſhall be paid for their feeding, becauſe there is Tithes of other things ariſing by the Labour of ſuch Cattle; but when they do no Work, and are turned off to be fatted and are graz'd, there Tithes ſhall be paid for the Herbage which they eat, they being no way beneficial to the Parſon in any other Tithes: And many Caſes in <hi>ſcacc'</hi> were cited to warrant this Diſtinction; and 'twas ſaid, That none could be alledged to the contrary, wherefore 'twas pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, That the Decree might be affirmed, and it was affirmed.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Then ſhe was deliver'd of a Daughter, and a few Hours after died, and the Daughter did ſurvive her near two Years, and then died: And after her Mother's Death (there being no Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor named) Adminiſtration of the Eſtate of the Teſtatrix was committed during the Minority of the Child with the Will annexed; but the Appellant poſſeſt her ſelf of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, being about 600 <hi>l.</hi> Value. Then after the Child's Death, the Appellant as next of Kin, took Adminiſtration to the Child, and alſo to Mrs. <hi>Granmare.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Reſpondent exhibited his Bill, claiming a Moiety of the <hi>Reſiduum</hi> by force of the Codicil, the Appellant by Anſwer in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted upon the Invalidity of the Agreement between <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Katherine,</hi> but that being waived, the Queſtion aroſe upon the words of the Will, and particularly theſe, <hi>donner des jours,</hi> and 'twas inſiſted, That nothing was deſigned to the Reſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, but only in caſe the Child were ſtill-born, or ſhould die in her lying in; whereupon the Court ordered the Cauſe to be continued in the Paper, and that both ſides ſhould take time to procure the Opinion of <hi>French</hi> Men born, and acquainted with the Laws of <hi>France,</hi> and the Cauſe coming on again to be heard before the Lord Chancellour; and upon reading of ſeveral Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of <hi>French</hi> Gentlemen bred to the Laws of that Country, the Court declared, That the Reſpondent was well intituled to his Moiety of the Reſidue, after the particular Legacies, Debts, Funerals, and other Allowances deducted, and decreed the ſame accordingly.</p>
            <p>It was argued on the behalf of the Appellant, That this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree was erroneous, that the proper Signification of thoſe words, was no more than to give Life, that it was ſo tranſlated at <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors Commons,</hi> That that Tranſlation does agree with the Opinion of ſeveral of the moſt learned Divines amongſt the <hi>French</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fugees here; That 'tis ſo interpreted in the Famous Dictionary of the <hi>French</hi> Academy, dedicated to that King, where the Words are as follows, <hi>viz. lés jours au pluriel, ſignifie la vie,</hi> That Days in the plural ſignifie Life, without any Determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of time; That there are few <hi>Frenchmen</hi> of any Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but will acknowledge, That by <hi>lés jours d'une perſonne,</hi> the Days of one (whether they be many or few in number) muſt be underſtood the Life, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That the Teſtatrix here could mean no other by Days, but Life; when ſhe ſaid, That in caſe it pleaſed God to take her out of this World, if it was his Will to give Days, to give Life to her Child, ſhe left it all that belonged to her; knowing well, That if the Child was born alive, it muſt be maintain'd from that Moment, out of what was ſo left it, that it appeared from the Preamble of the Codicil, <hi>viz.</hi>
               <pb n="196" facs="tcp:50172:105"/>In caſe it ſhall pleaſe God to take away my Child, as well as my ſelf, then, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That the Teſtatrix never intended the Eſtate to go over, unleſs the Child died as well as her ſelf in her ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in.</p>
            <p>Then it was argued from the Nature of the particular Lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies; they were of ſuch a ſort, as that they muſt be given with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Senſe or Reaſon, had ſhe not ſuppoſed her Child's Death, as well as her own, in her lying in; for otherwiſe thoſe new Ribbons muſt become old, which were intended as a Preſent to a young Gentlewoman, Clothes lockt up in a Trunk would have been of no uſe to Perſons then in Diſtreſs, and the poor Orphan had gone too far in Years to learn a Trade. Then other Things are given as Tokens to be kept, and worn by them for her ſake, as long as they lived: Now what Reaſon can be aſſigned for this, if ſhe did not mean and ſuppoſe a Death in her lying in: From whence it was inferred, That the Intention of the Teſtatrix was to give all ſhe had to her Child, in caſe ſhe ſurvived her; and if it did not ſurvive her, but was taken away as well as her ſelf, in her lying in, then her Intention was to give that ſame All (which ſhe had given to her Child) to other People, as ſpecified in the Will; and unleſs this were the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, the Child muſt have ſtarved, or lived upon Charity, not having the Property of what was left it; and the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion precedent, according to the Reſpondents Expoſition, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes the Child till its Years of Diſcretion; wherefore 'twas prayed that the Decree might be reverſed.</p>
            <p>On the other ſide it was argued with the Decree, that the ſame was juſt; that no Objection could ariſe from the Nature of the other Legacies, or of this, as being reaſonable or unreaſonable; for that 'tis the Natural Right and Priviledge of every Perſon, to diſpoſe of that which they have, at their pleaſure, to do what they will with their own; a Priviledge ſo certain, that tho' 'tis uſed many times to ill purpoſes, yet the Law cannot inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, nor reſtrain the Proprietor, no not to preſerve him and his Family from ruine, as daily Experience ſhews: That it is agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to Law and Juſtice, and to true Piety, to ſee that the Will of the Dead be performed; and tho' the Law have aſcertained how Eſtates ſhall go, when there is no Will, yet when there is a Will that diſpoſes of it otherwiſe, then the Law would do; the Courts below will compel a Performance of ſuch a Diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as the Will directs.</p>
            <p>Then 'twas ſaid, That the Intention of the Teſtatrix, in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the Reſpondent, is both Charitable and Prudent; He was her neareſt Relation in <hi>England,</hi> and conſidering a great part of what ſhe left was once her Husbands, ſhe honourably gave as much to his, as to her own Relations, making her Husband's Siſter, and the Reſpondent <hi>Charles,</hi> reſiduary Legatees to ſhare equally, and ſo is the Decree: And to Reverſe this Decree, and
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:50172:105"/>permit the Appellant to go away with the whole, (as ſhe muſt, if the Decree be reverſed) doth directly deſtroy all the Prudent and Charitable Intentions of the Teſtatrix, and carries the Eſtate where ſhe never deſigned it, <hi>viz.</hi> to the Appellant.</p>
            <p>Then 'twas argued, That the Court of <hi>Chancery</hi> had done well in taking the Opinion of Perſons skilled and knowing in the Matter in queſtion; that the Gentlemen of the Long-Robe of that Country, now here in <hi>London,</hi> did all give their Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions; that according to their Conſtruction of theſe words in a Will, it was an arrival to Years of Maturity or Age enabling to diſpoſe; that unleſs the Child had lived to ſuch an Age, as that ſhe had been capable to give the ſame away, her Repreſentative in this Caſe, could not be intituled to it.</p>
            <p>Then 'was ſaid, That words are to be interpreted according to the Senſe and Acceptation of thoſe which uſe them: That the Teſtatrix was a Native of <hi>France,</hi> and therefore this method of Inquiring into her Meaning was juſt and reaſonable: That the Courts at Law have frequently conſulted Merchants about the ſignification of Mercantile Terms, and <hi>Trinity Houſe</hi> about Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine Phraſes; ſo in like manner Grammarians, Criticks, Chymiſts, and Artificers have been in the Court of <hi>Kings Bench</hi> conſulted, according to the Nature of the Thing in queſtion, upon words belonging to, and uſed in their reſpective Profeſſions: That in caſe of words diſpoſing of an Eſtate in a Foreign Language, by the Will of a Foreigner, the Judgment of Divines or Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marians could be no proper Direction to the Court of <hi>Chancery;</hi> but the Means of Information muſt be from thoſe who were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the Rules of Interpretation in Caſe of Wills a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt thoſe People: That the Opinion of thoſe Gentlemen was ſufficient to juſtifie the Decree.</p>
            <p>But then it was further argued, That here the Meaning of the Teſtatrix could not be ſuch as the Appellant would pretend, <hi>i.e.</hi> that ſhe meant to give her Eſtate to the Reſpondent and others, only in caſe the Child ſhe then went with ſhould be ſtill born, or if born alive, ſhould dye with the Mother in her lying in, for theſe Reaſons: Firſt, For that ſhe was ſo far from apprehending that the Child would either be ſtill born, or if born alive, would dye as ſoon as her ſelf, or in her lying in, that ſhe expected 'twould live, and, as ſhe hoped, to full Age, for ſhe takes par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Care of its Education; and earneſtly recommends the ſame to the now Appellant, and others; prays God to bleſs it, and not forſake it; and hoped that all the Relations on the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's ſide would, for the Father's ſake, do it all the Services it ſhould ſtand in need of.</p>
            <p>Then taking it that the Teſtatrix did expect the Child to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live her, (as unqueſtionably ſhe did) if her meaning had been ſuch as the Appellant hath put upon her words, the way to have it ſure fixt to the Child, and then to the Appellant, had been to
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:50172:106"/>have made no Will at all; becauſe if the Child ſurvived the Mother but a day, or an hour, or never ſo little, the Law had veſted the whole, firſt in the Child in its own Right, and upon the Child's deceaſe, in the Appellant, as Adminiſtratrix to the Child.</p>
            <p>Suppoſe the Child had outlived the Mother for a Month, or the like, what Interpretation could have been put upon this Will? All their Arguments will hold as well to a Month, Week, or Days ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving of the Mother, as to this of two Years; and therefore it muſt be thus conſtrued to be her Intent, that the Deviſes over ſhould take effect, if the Child ſhould not live to an Age of Maturity, and Power of Diſpoſition.</p>
            <p>And as to the pretence of the Child's ſtarving in the mean time, there neither is, nor can be any weight in that, for the Intereſt and Produce of the whole, during all that time, muſt remain and be to and for the benefit of the Child. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, upon the whole Matter, 'twas prayed that the Decree ſhould be affirmed; and it was affirmed.</p>

            <p>WRit of Error to Reverſe a Judgment of Reverſal given in the <hi>Exchequer Chamber,</hi> upon a Judgment given in the <hi>Kings Bench</hi> for the Plaintiffs, in an Action of Treſpaſs for the mean Profits, after a Recovery in Ejectment, and Poſſeſſion had thereupon: The Caſe was this upon Record; The Plaintiffs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare that the Defendant, 1 <hi>Sept.</hi> 1672. their Cloſe, <hi>&amp;c. vi &amp; armis,</hi> &amp;c. did break, and upon the Poſſeſſion of the Plaintiff did enter, and the Plaintiffs from their Poſſeſſion did expel and remove, and them ſo being removed and expelled for a long time, <hi>viz.</hi> from the ſaid 1 <hi>Sept.</hi> 1672. to the time of exhibiting the Bill, <hi>viz.</hi> 6 <hi>May</hi> 1685. did hold out from the ſame, by which they loſt the Proſits thereof, <hi>&amp;c. Et al' Enormia,</hi> &amp;c. The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant by Plea takes Iſſue as to the Force, and Iſſue thereon; and as to part of the Treſpaſs, pleads the Statute of Limitations; and as to the reſidue of the Treſpaſs, pleads that Sir <hi>William Portman</hi> made a Leaſe to one <hi>Trowbridge</hi> for 1000 years, and by <hi>meſne</hi> Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignments derives a Title down to <hi>Thomas Nicholas;</hi> and that he in his Life time, by Indenture, aſſigned to the Defendant.</p>
            <p>The Plaintiffs Reply, and as to the firſt part of the Plea, <hi>viz.</hi> of the Statute of Limitations, they demur; and as to the other part of the Plea, they tender a Traverſe, and deny that <hi>Thomas Nicholas</hi> did aſſign the Premiſſes to the Defendant.</p>
            <p>The Defendant joyns in Demurrer, as to the firſt part of the Plea, <hi>viz.</hi> the Statute of Limitations: And as to the other part, ſhe takes Iſſue upon the Traverſe; which Iſſue is joyned; and a <hi>Venire</hi> awarded <hi>tam ad triand'</hi> the two Iſſues, <hi>quam ad inquirend' de dampnis</hi> upon the Demurrer.</p>
            <p>The Jury find that <hi>Thomas Nicholas</hi> was poſſeſſed in manner as the Defendant in her Plea hath alledged, and that he did make Seal, and as his Deed, deliver the Indenture in the Plea menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned; which ſaid Indenture follows in theſe words; and ſo ſet forth the whole; in which, after a Recital of the Leaſe, and a Deducement of the Title down, are theſe words, <hi>viz. The ſaid</hi> Thomas, <hi>as well for and in conſideration of the natural Love and Affection which he beareth to the Defendant his Grand child, as for other good Cauſes and Conſiderations, hath granted, aſſigned, and ſet over, and by theſe Preſents doth grant, aſſign, and ſet over unto the ſaid</hi> Mary, <hi>her Executors, Administrators, and Aſſigns, all the ſaid Cottage, Barn, and Lands, and all and ſingular other the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſes herein before recited or mentioned, with the Appurtenances to the ſame belonging or appertaining; together with the ſaid recited
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:50172:107"/>Leaſe, and all Writings and Evidences touching the Premiſſes, to have and to hold the ſaid Cottage, Barn, and Premiſſes, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry part thereof, with the Appurtenances, unto the ſaid Defendant</hi> Mary, <hi>her Executors, Adminiſtrators and Aſſigns, from and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately after the Death and Deceaſe of the ſaid</hi> Thomas Nicholas, <hi>party to theſe preſents, and</hi> Mary <hi>his Wife unto the end of the term; and for and during all the reſt and reſidne of the ſaid term of</hi> 1000 <hi>Years, which ſhall be therein to come and unexpired, by and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the yearly Rents, Covenants,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>expreſſed in the ſaid Original Indenture of Leaſe.</hi> Then the Jury leave it to the Court, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Deed of Aſſignment be good in Law or not, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude ſpecially, if the Aſſignment be not good in Law, then they find for the Plaintiffs, and Aſſeſs, Damages, 50 <hi>l.</hi> and 40 <hi>s.</hi> Coſts, and thereupon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now it was argued for the Plaintiff; and it was ſaid in the firſt place, That this Caſe was extraordinary, that tho' the Majority of the Judges in <hi>Weſtminster-hall</hi> were of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with the Plaintiffs, yet they were forced to ſue this Writ, they had the four Judges of the <hi>King</hi>'s-<hi>Bench,</hi> and the then Mr. Juſtice <hi>Powell,</hi> and the then Baron <hi>Powell</hi> concurring with the <hi>King</hi>'s-<hi>Bench;</hi> and the chief Baron <hi>Atkins</hi> being abſent, the other Five in the <hi>Exchequer-Chamber</hi> reverſed the Judgment, it having been reſolved upon the Stat. of <hi>Eliz.</hi> which erects that Juriſdiction, That the Concurrence of ſix are not neceſſary to reverſe, but only that ſix muſt be preſent to make a Court; ſo that here were ſix to five for the Plaintiff, and yet he hath loſt it.</p>
            <p>Then it was argued, That there had been two Things inſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on below, one was the finding of Damages generally, and the other was as to the Validity of the Aſſignment; and as to the finding, it was ſaid, That the Matter of the Force is meer Form; and if there had been no <hi>non proſequi,</hi> the ſame could not make an Error; That in <hi>C. B.</hi> and <hi>B. R.</hi> the Iſſue upon the <hi>vi &amp; armis, &amp;c.</hi> is ſeldom or never taken notice of, no Entry is made of it upon the <hi>poſtea</hi> at all, unleſs a wounding or ſome ſuch other ſpecial Matter were mixt with it, in the ſame Iſſue; That 'tis held in the Caſe of <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>King,</hi> 1 <hi>Saund'.</hi> 81. If nothing be anſwered to the <hi>vi &amp; armis</hi> in a ſpecial Plea, 'tis well upon a general Demurrer, and the 7 <hi>Hen.</hi> 6. 13. and 1 <hi>Hen.</hi> 7.19. are plain, That if the Party have the ſpecial Matter which he pleads, found for him, the <hi>vi &amp; armis</hi> ſhall not be inquired of: So if the Defendant have Judgment againſt him, upon Demurrer to the ſpecial Matter pleaded by him, the <hi>vi &amp; armis</hi> ſhall never be tried, tho' Iſſue were joyned upon it, but the Party ſhall be fined upon the <hi>Capiatur, &amp;c.</hi> without any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry: So is the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Hopper,</hi> 2 <hi>Cro.</hi> 599. in a <hi>Scire Facias,</hi> on a Recognizance for the good Behaviour, ſpecial Matter pleaded, held, That the Jury need not inquire about the <hi>vi &amp;
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:50172:107"/>armis,</hi> if ſuch Special Matter be found for the Defendant; much more is it ſo, in caſe it be found for the Plaintiff, for there the Act which is found imports it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and it ſhall be intended to be <hi>vi &amp; armis,</hi> &amp;c. and the Book of <hi>Hen.</hi> 6. is full in it, no need of any Inquiry in ſuch Caſe. And in this Point both the Courts having concurred, the Counſel for the Defendant did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt it.</p>
            <p>Then as to the other Matter of the Damages, which ſhould have been inquired of upon the Demurrer, 'twas ſaid, That they were releaſed upon Record; and, 'tis plain, that the Jury have found nothing upon that, becauſe the Concluſion of the Verdict doth ſhew, that they inquired and found Damages only as to the <hi>conceſſit</hi> or <hi>aſſignavit;</hi> they aſſeſs Damages for nothing elſe; for if the Deed did paſs the term, then they find for the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff, and aſſeſs Damages; and if the term did not paſs, they find the Defendant Not guilty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the Damages cannot therefore be for both; for if they had found any for the Matter demurred upon, it muſt have been with a <hi>ſi Contingat;</hi> here 'tis not ſo. And tho' the Special Fact found had been againſt the Plaintiff, it might have been for him upon the Demurrer, and conſequently the conditional finding of the Damages here, can never be as to that.</p>
            <p>Then it was further ſaid, That this might be ſupplied by an Inqueſt of Office, in caſe it had not been releaſed; and there was cited <hi>Cheyney</hi>'s Caſe, <hi>Mich.</hi> 10 <hi>Jac.</hi> 1. 10 <hi>Rep.</hi> 118, 119. <hi>Writ de Valore maritagij,</hi> Iſſue on the Tenure, and Verdict for the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff, and no Value found of the Marriage; and held ill, becauſe they ſay, an Attaint lyes upon it, that being the Point of the Writ; and there the Rule is taken generally, that where an At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taint lyes upon the finding, the omiſſion of finding ſuch Matter cannot be ſupplied by a new Writ of Inquiry, becauſe ſuch Writ of Inquiry would prevent the Party of the Benefit of his At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taint.</p>
            <p>Then the Book ſays further, That the Rule is, that the Court <hi>ex Officio,</hi> ought to inquire of ſuch thing upon which no Attaint lyes; and there the omiſſion of its being found in the Verdict, may be ſupplyed by a Writ of Inquiry of Damages; as in the caſe of a <hi>Quare Impedit,</hi> (<hi>Poyner</hi>'s Caſe, <hi>Dyer</hi> 135.) Iſſue found for the Plaintiff; but the Jury <hi>per</hi> negligence were not charged to inquire of the four Points, Plenarty, <hi>ex cujus Preſentatione, ſi Tempus Semeſtre,</hi> and the yearly Value of the Church; there a Writ of Inquiry lyes <hi>de novo,</hi> becauſe upon them no Attaint lyes; as is the 11 <hi>Hen.</hi> 4.80. becauſe as to them 'tis only an Inqueſt of Office; and the Book ſays further, That all the Caſes to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary of that Rule have paſſed, <hi>ſub ſilentio,</hi> without due Adviſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and were againſt the Rule of Law: So in the Caſe of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue,</hi> the omiſſion of the Value in the finding is fatal, becauſe an Attaint lyes upon a falſe Verdict in that particular: So that by the Caſe cited, it may be only an Inqueſt of Office as to part, which is the preſent Caſe. In that Caſe of a <hi>Quare Impedit</hi> in <hi>Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi>
               <pb n="202" facs="tcp:50172:108"/>is cited a Preſident for it, in the <hi>Old Book</hi> of <hi>Entries,</hi> 110. which is a falſe Folio, for 'tis in 93. <hi>b.</hi> and there is the very En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of the Writ, ſetting forth a <hi>Recuperavit preſentation' virtute Breais de Niſi prius, Et quia neſcitur utrum Eccleſia plena,</hi> &amp;c. And as the Caſe is in <hi>Dyer,</hi> the Plaintiff did there (as the Plaintiff doth here) releaſe his Damages, and had a Writ to the Biſhop. Now in <hi>Heydon</hi>'s Caſe, 11 <hi>Rep.</hi> 6. 'tis held that no Attaint lyes upon an Inqueſt of Office; and therefore 'tis, that if in a Treſpaſs againſt divers Defendants, ſome plead to Iſſue, and one ſuffers Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to go by Default, the Damages found on the Iſſue ſhall be chargeable upon all, and the Inquiry of Damages on the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by Default ſhall ſtay, becauſe no Attaint lyes upon that. 'Tis there alſo ſaid, that attaint lyes only on a Verdict on the <hi>miſe</hi> of the Parties: In Treſpaſs, three Iſſues, <hi>Non culp'</hi> to one part, Preſcription for a Common to another part, and the Cattle <hi>raptim momorderunt</hi> in going to take Common to another, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Jury find one for the Plaintiff, and another for the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant, and inquire not of the third Iſſue at all; the Plaintiff re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquiſhing his Damages on the third Iſſue, prays Judgment on the Verdict for the firſt, and held that this prevented all Error, <hi>Mich.</hi> 13 <hi>Car.</hi> 1. <hi>B. R. Brown</hi> and <hi>Stephens,</hi> adjudged, 1 <hi>Rolls A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridg.</hi> 786. Then as to the Caſe of <hi>Vaſtuman</hi> and <hi>Row,</hi> 11 <hi>Car.</hi> 1. <hi>B. R.</hi> in 2 <hi>Rolls Abridg.</hi> 722. Treſpaſs for an Aſſault, Battery, and taking Corn; Special Plea to the Battery, and Demurrer there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, and <hi>Non culp'</hi> to the taking the Corn; the Jury find no Damages upon the Demurrer; ſaid there, That when Judgment is for the Plaintiff on the Demurrer, the Damages for it cannot be aſſeſſed on a Writ of Inquiry, but a <hi>Venire Facias de novo</hi> for the whole: 'Twas now argued, that that was expreſly againſt the Rule in <hi>Cheyney</hi>'s Caſe, and that in the Caſe in <hi>Rolls;</hi> 'tis put with the addition of a <hi>dubitatur.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if that be Law, there needs no Writ of Inquiry in this Caſe, becauſe the Damages, as to that part, are releaſed; and for this, there is the expreſs Caſe of <hi>Bentham,</hi> 11 <hi>Rep.</hi> 56. In Annui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the Parties deſcended to Iſſue, found for the Plaintiff as to the Arrearages, but no Damages and Coſts; 'twas held an imperfect Verdict, and that it could not be ſupplyed by Writ of Inquiry of Damages; yet the Plaintiff releaſing the Damages and Coſts had Judgment for him; and a Writ of Error was brought, and the Inſufficiency of the Verdict was aſſigned for Error; but the Judgment was affirmed, becauſe the Plaintiff had releaſed it, <hi>Dyer</hi> 369, 370. <hi>Ejection' cuſtod' terre &amp; hered',</hi> and ill, becauſe intire Damages; and for the <hi>beres</hi> no Ejectment lyes; yet the Damages being releaſed, he had Judgment for the Land. And 'twas ſaid to be there held, That inſufficient finding of Damages, and finding of none, are all one. If a Releaſe of that which is ill found, will help, where ſuch thing releaſed is directly in Iſſue; much more it ſhould do ſo, where the thing releaſed is but obliquely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of, and was not put in Iſſue to the Jury; and then 'twas repeated what was ſaid before, that the Special Concluſion helps
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:50172:108"/>and prevents the General Intendment which otherwiſe would be had, as to the Damages being intire, and therefore 'twas inſiſted that this made no Error, but the Judgment in the <hi>Kings Bench</hi> ſtood good, notwithſtanding this Exception. Then the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fel for the Defendant did likewiſe wave this, as not being the Cauſe of the Reverſal in the <hi>Exchequer Chamber.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherefore it was argued for the Plaintiff, That this Aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or Grant found in the Verdict is void, and paſſed nothing; for that either it paſſed the whole Term, or no part of it, and that immediately; that this muſt be agreed. Then 'twas ſaid, that it could not paſs the whole; for ſo to do, was contrary to the Intention of all the Parties, to the good will of the Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, and even to the hopes of the Grantee; for 'tis plain from the whole Contexture of the Deed, that the Defendant was to have nothing in the Term till the Death of the old Man and his Wife: It was undoubtedly the meaning and deſign of all the Perſons concerned, that the Defendant only ſhould have the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidue after his deceaſe.</p>
            <p>Then that the Law will not permit this, is plain from the Books, for that 'tis uncertain, how much, or if any of the term will remain, or be in being, at the death of the Grantor or Aſſignor; that the Law rejects ſuch a ſmall or remote Poſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; that Man's Life in the Eye of the Law is of ſo great a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, that 'tis preſumed to be of a longer duration than the lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt term of years: That this is an old Maxim, upon which Thouſands of Properties do depend, that tho' ſome Mens rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon may not approve it, 'tis not to be altered but by the Legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lature; that the Law firſt prefers Inheritances, or Eſtates deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible; then Freeholds, or Eſtates for Life; then Chattels real or Terms for Years: The Law values and regards, what a Man and his Heirs ſhall enjoy, before that which he himſelf only can en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy; and what he himſelf may enjoy during his Life, before what he may have only for a certain limited time, the which he may by any ſuppoſal ſurvive: Theſe are known Truths. 32 <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſ.</hi> 6. <hi>Plowd,</hi> 521. If a Man be poſſeſſed of a Term for 100 years, and grants ſo many of them as ſhall remain at the time of his death, this is void for the uncertainty; otherwiſe if it be by Deviſe, becauſe there nothing takes effect till death, and then 'tis certain how many years he is to enjoy it. 'Tis true, a Leaſe of Land for Forty years, to commence after a Man's death, is good, becauſe 'tis certain that the Land ſhall be enjoyed for Forty years, but here <hi>non conſtat</hi> in certain, that this Deed could take effect for a year, an hour, or at all; <hi>Bro. tit. Leaſe</hi> 66. <hi>Plowd.</hi> 520. A Man poſſeſſed of a Term, grants it to another during Life, 'tis as much as during the whole Term (tho' never ſo long) becauſe Life is preſumed longer; ſo if he grant all the Term that ſhall remain after his Death, 'tis all void, becauſe he reſerves to himſelf the whole; for a greater includes the leſs; and for Life is the longeſt of the two: Theſe things are not to
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:50172:109"/>be diſputed: If both Premiſſes and <hi>Habendum</hi> had had this Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation, the other ſide muſt have agreed it to have been void <hi>ab origine,</hi> and nothing to have paſſed by this Deed.</p>
            <p>But then the Objection is, That the whole Term paſſes by the Granting Part, and then the <hi>Habendum</hi> is void, becauſe 'tis repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. To this it was anſwered. That in a Deed each part hath its proper Province: The Office of the Premiſſes is to expreſs the certainty of the thing granted; the <hi>Habendum</hi> is to expreſs the quantity and limitation of the Eſtate, 1 <hi>Inſt.</hi> 6. <hi>Plowd.</hi> 196. <hi>Lofield</hi>'s Caſe, 10 <hi>Rep.</hi> 107. And according to <hi>Littleton</hi>'s Text, <hi>Sect.</hi> 370. all the parts of the Indenture are but one Deed in Law: from whence it was inferred, That the <hi>Habendum</hi> is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to be rejected, but when there is a manifeſt, expreſs, and particular Contradiction; never when the <hi>Habendum</hi> doth appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently ſhew the Parties Intention.</p>
            <p>Here the Leſſee for years grants <hi>totum Cottagium ſuum,</hi> &amp;c. The Grantee or Aſſignee (if there be no <hi>Habendum</hi>) hath but an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate at will; whereas if he grants all his Eſtate and Intereſt in ſuch a Cottage, there the whole Term paſſeth. This is the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Opinion in <hi>Griffin</hi>'s Caſe, 2 <hi>Leon.</hi> 78. <hi>Caſe</hi> 102. and there ſaid to have been lately ſo adjudged in <hi>Wynnibank</hi>'s Caſe in <hi>B. R.</hi> Now here's nothing in the Premiſſes, but what is general, not the whole Eſtate granted; nor is it ſaid for how long time he ſhall enjoy it; and therefore the <hi>Habendum</hi> cannot be ſaid to be repugnant or contradictory, becauſe the firſt is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Stukely</hi>'s Caſe, <hi>Hob.</hi> 170, 171. upon the Caſe of Grants and Exceptions, is the learning of <hi>Habendums</hi> laid down, if it had been a Grant of all his Eſtate, <hi>Habendum</hi> after his Death, there the <hi>Habendum</hi> ſhall not fruſtrate the Grant; but if the Premiſſes give no certain or expreſs Eſtate, there you may alter and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge, nay, you may utterly fruſtrate it by the <hi>Habendum;</hi> theſe are the words of the Book: Then was cited 2 <hi>Rolls abr.</hi> 66. and 1 <hi>Inſt.</hi> 48. <hi>b.</hi> and the ſame Caſe of <hi>Hodge</hi> and <hi>Croſſe,</hi> in 3 <hi>Cro.</hi> 254, 255, where 'twas ruled, That the <hi>Habendum,</hi> tho' void, ſhall controul the implied Limitation in the Premiſſes; 'twas a Feoffment of Lands in <hi>London, Habend'</hi> to the Feoffee and his Heirs after the Death of the Feoffer: And 'twas argued in that Caſe, That the <hi>Habend'</hi> was void, but reſolved, That no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing paſſes, becauſe it appears to be the Intent of the Party, that nothing ſhould paſs but <hi>in futuro;</hi> for the Premiſſes could paſs nothing but by Implication, and that was nothing at all, becauſe the Intent was to paſs nothing preſently; and tho' there were Livery made, yet that Livery could operate only <hi>ſecundum formam Charte,</hi> and therefore the whole was void; the reaſon was, becauſe the firſt was General, tho' the Law would have given a particular Eſtate for Life by the Livery; yet becauſe the Party gave none expreſly by particular Words, the <hi>Habendum</hi> was not to be rejected; many of the Rules in <hi>Buckler</hi> and <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey</hi>'s
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:50172:109"/>Caſe, 2 <hi>Rep.</hi> 55. are applicable to this: And altho' there be a Difference, where the Deed paſſes the Eſtate, and where Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very or other Ceremony is requiſite, as to many purpoſes; yet ſtill the Diſtinction is, where the Premiſſes do not give all the Parties whole Intereſt, or ſome other particular Eſtate, but is Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, there the <hi>Habendum</hi> ſhall not be rejected as repugnant, 2 <hi>Rep.</hi> 23, 24. <hi>Baldwin</hi>'s Caſe.</p>
            <p>As to the Words, together with the ſaid recited Leaſe, that can only mean the Indenture or Writing; for the Adjective <hi>recited,</hi> implies the Intent to be ſuch: <hi>Recited</hi> ſignifies only a Rehearſal or Repetition of Words, ſpoken or written before; and ſo is <hi>Recitare Teſtamentum, Calvin</hi>'s <hi>Lexicon,</hi> and 'tis joined with the other Writings and Evidences concerning the Premiſſes, and doubtful Words are to be conſtrued according to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the things expreſſed and mentioned with them: Leaſe in it ſelf imports only the Conveyance or Inſtrument of Convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, not the Intereſt in the thing conveyed; if by Writing, 'tis called a Deed or Leaſe in Writing, if otherwiſe, a Leaſe Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rol: Thus is it explained in <hi>Blunt</hi>'s <hi>Law Dictionary,</hi> and in <hi>Knight</hi>'s Caſe, 5 <hi>Rep.</hi> 55. where all the Parts of it are deſcribed: A Man may give away his Leaſe, and yet retain his Eſtate or Term, he may depoſite it as a Pawn or Pledge; and the Party in whoſe Cuſtody 'tis ſo lodged, may maintain Trover or Treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs, if it be taken from him, nay, againſt the Leſſee himſelf, the Owner of the Lands, if he takes it before the Performance of the Condition; ſo that theſe Words cannot alter the Caſe; this is not the Caſe of a Will, but of a Deed Executed in the Life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time of the Party; the Rule, and the Reaſon of the Rule about Exceptions in Grants, will hold to this; where the Grant is General, the Exception cannot be rejected as void, on pretence of Repugnancy: The Common Law doth not care to raiſe, or make Eſtates by Implication where the ſame Perſon hath an expreſs one, ſo is <hi>Vaughan,</hi> 261, 262. therefore there's no Reaſon in this Caſe, to conſtrue the whole Term to paſs by Implication in the Premiſſes, a particular Eſtate being limited in the <hi>Habend',</hi> and that not being good, all is void: Here's no Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſer, Creditor, or Heir in the Caſe, but 'tis a meer voluntary Act to the Defendant.</p>
            <p>Then was cited 1 <hi>Cro.</hi> 376. 2 <hi>Bulſtr.</hi> 272. of a Copy-holders Surrender, <hi>Habend' a tempore mortis,</hi> and held void; wherefore upon the whole, it was inſiſted, That by the Premiſſes, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing paſſed but an Eſtate at Will, That the <hi>Habend'</hi> giving an Eſtate or Intereſt, which was not allowable in the Law, the Deed was void, and paſſed nothing; and therefore the Verdict was for the Plaintiff, and the Judgment in <hi>B. R.</hi> was good, and accordingly it was prayed, That the Reverſal of that Judgment might be reverſed.</p>
            <pb n="206" facs="tcp:50172:110"/>
            <p>On the other ſide, it was argued, That to conſtrue this to be void, was contrary to the Intention of both the Parties; That now the Grantor and his Wife were dead, and there was no diſpute about their Eſtates: That the Premiſſes here paſſed the whole, 'tis to her and her Executors and Aſſigns, 'tis all that Cottage; 'tis together with all his Deeds concerning it, the Deeds are concomitant with the Eſtate, and when he grants the Deeds, he certainly did deſign to paſs his Intereſt; he could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver mean an Eſtate at Will, when he names the Executors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Then was cited the Caſe of <hi>Lilley</hi> and <hi>Witney, Dyer</hi> 272. <hi>pl.</hi> 30. Grant of all his Intereſt, Eſtate, and Term, <hi>Habend'</hi> after his Death, the <hi>Habend'</hi> is void, <hi>Plowd.</hi> 520. 1 <hi>Bulſtr.</hi> 191. <hi>Bro.</hi> Grants, 154. Leaſes 66. The Preſumption that a Man can out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live a 1000 Years, is a weak Pretence, and void of Reaſon: Equity is a part of the Law of the Land; and here to judge this void, is unconſcionable and unreaſonable.

            <p>Upon the arguing of this ſpecial Verdict, the Court below was of Opinion, That <hi>Benjamin</hi> was intituled, to <hi>Anne</hi>'s Share of <hi>Hezekiah</hi>'s Part, as he was Brother and Heir of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> viz. That by the Will, the Fee-ſimple and Inheritance of a Thirty-ſixth Part or Share of the <hi>New-River</hi> Water was given to, and veſted in each of the youger Children; and that on the Death of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> one of the younger Children, unmarried, under One and Twenty Years of Age, by the Clauſe (whereby the Shares of the youger Children dying before Twenty One, and unmarried, are given to the ſurviving Children, Share and Share alike) the five Survivors became Tenants in Common, and each was ſeized of a fifth part only for Life, and not in Fee: That the Reverſion of <hi>Hezekiah</hi>'s Share, <hi>expectant</hi> on the deaths of the younger Children, deſcended to the ſaid <hi>Benjamin</hi> his Brother and Heir; and that he on the death of <hi>Anne,</hi> ought to have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed that Fifth-part in Poſſeſſion; and therefore the Profits of it received by <hi>Swayne,</hi> were due to <hi>Benjamin,</hi> and Judgment accordingly given there for <hi>Benjamin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now it was argued, That this Judgment was erroneous, for that by Virtue of the ſaid Deviſe, the ſaid <hi>Anne</hi> had an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance in her part of <hi>Hezekiah</hi>'s Share, for theſe Reaſons, 1. It is well known and agreed, That a Part or Share in the <hi>New-River</hi> is an Inheritance, and therefore the Deviſe of all that Part or Share to any Perſon, is a Deviſe of that Part and
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:50172:111"/>Share to ſuch Perſon and his Heirs; and is as much, as if a Perſon being ſeized in Fee of Lands, ſhould ſay in his Will, he deviſes all his Eſtate in thoſe Lands to <hi>J. S.</hi> it could be no queſtion, but ſuch a Deviſe would convey the ſaid Lands to ſuch Deviſee and his Heirs. 2. The Share of <hi>Hezekiah</hi> was given to him and his Heirs, proportionably charged with the payment of the Fee-Farm Rent to his Majeſty, and with 100 <hi>l. per Annum</hi> to <hi>Henry M.</hi> and his Heirs, and alſo with 150 <hi>l.</hi> to his Brother <hi>Benjamin;</hi> and being thus charged, upon his dying before Age or Marriage, his Share, with the Profits thereof thus charged, is given to his younger Brother and Siſters, the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vivor and Survivors of them, Share and Share alike. Then 'tis obſervable, that the Fee-Farm Rent, payable to the King, his Heirs and Succeſſors, is 500 <hi>l. per Annum;</hi> upon which account 'twould be very difficult to conceive, that the Teſtator, by this Deviſe of the deceaſed's Part, to the Survivors, Share and Share alike, did intend to ſuch Survivors only an Eſtate for Life, when at the ſame time he ſubjects and charges it to and with the proportionable payment of the ſaid yearly Fee-Farm, and the 100 <hi>l.</hi> to <hi>H. M.</hi> and his Heirs, which are Rent-Charges in Fee, and cannot reaſonably be underſtood to be charged on E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates given barely for Life.</p>
            <p>Beſides, The Point here is upon the Conſtruction of a Will, and the Teſtators true Intent and Meaning, in any part that is obſcure, ought to be collected out of any other part or words of the Will that may explain it: Now, it being plain, that <hi>Hezekiah</hi>'s Part was a Fee-ſimple, and thus charged, it ſeems to be as plain, that the very Inheritance of that Part, ſhould upon his death go and remain to the Survivors, Share and Share alike; that is to ſay, That they ſhould be Tenants in Common in Fee-ſimple of that Part, the ſame being thus chargable with the two Rents, and with the 150 <hi>l.</hi> to <hi>Benjamin;</hi> for otherwiſe this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe over (which was deſigned in their favour and for their benefit) might have turned to ſome of their Loſſes and Prejudice, for they might have paid the 150 <hi>l.</hi> to <hi>Benjamin,</hi> and have died, before they were re-imburſed out of <hi>Hezekiah</hi>'s Share, had the ſame been only an Eſtate for Life; and it cannot eaſily be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, that he intended his youngeſt Children by the ſecond Wife, ſhould have a better Eſtate in his Shares of the <hi>New-River</hi> Water, deviſed as aforeſaid, then the younger Children by the firſt Wife had, but that their Shares in it ſhould be equal; but by this Conſtruction, <hi>Benjamin</hi> by the ſecond Venter muſt carry away <hi>Anne</hi>'s Share from her Siſters and Brother of the firſt Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; here's no need of the common Care in conſtruing Wills, not to diſinherit an Heir by general words; for <hi>Hugh</hi> is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inherited by this Will, whether this ſurviving Intereſt be a Fee, or for Life: The Intention here was to make an equal Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for all the younger Children; the Part and Share of the Perſon dying, is the Inheritance in the Part and Share of the Perſon dying in the <hi>New-River</hi> Water. The three Siſters were
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:50172:112"/>to have their Shares diſcharged of the Fee-Farm Bent; but if this be only an Eſtate for Life, then thoſe who were deſigned to have the leaſt benefit by the Will, are to have the greateſt, for they are Heirs to <hi>Hezekiah;</hi> whereas the Children by the firſt Venter ſeem to be moſt favoured by the Will, becauſe they are to have their Bequeſts free from thoſe Incumbrances. The Teſtator recites his own Sciſin in Fee of ſo many Parts and Shares, and then deviſes thoſe Parts in Fee, how can this Clauſe of Limitation to Survivors be conſtrued to mean other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, then that the whole Fee of that proportion ſhould ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive. The Caſes cited in <hi>Rolls,</hi> on the other ſide, are only De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſes of the Land, and not of his Share.</p>
            <p>Then 'twas ſaid, That here was no Tenancy in Common; that 'tis true, equally divided, and equally to be divided, make a Tenancy in Common; but 'tis upon the account of the word <hi>divided;</hi> that to two equally, will not be ſo conſtrued, 1 <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d.</hi> 29. and if the words <hi>equally</hi> will not, why ſhould <hi>Share and Share alike;</hi> theſe words do not ſhew any partition of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate in Fact, nor in the Intention of the Teſtator; and one of theſe is neceſſary to prevent a Survivorſhip. Wherefore, upon the whole it was prayed, That the Judgment ſhould be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed.</p>
            <p>On the other ſide it was argued with the Judgment, That the ſame was Legal, and ought not to be Reverſed; for that as to the laſt thing ſtirred, it muſt be a Tenancy in Common; the words <hi>Share and Share alike</hi> imply a Diviſion, or Partition <hi>in eſſe,</hi> or <hi>in future,</hi> and it hath always been ſo conſtrued. The diſtinction between <hi>divided,</hi> and <hi>to be divided,</hi> hath been long ſince Exploded, as importing no difference.</p>
            <p>Then it was argued, That here was only an Eſtate for Life given by this Clauſe to the Survivors; that a Deviſe of the Share is the ſame with the Deviſe of the Land; that the Share doth not ſignifie the Eſtate or Intereſt, but the Quantity or Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Thing; here are no words to veſt the Inheritance in the Survivors; there are proper words to give an Inheritance to the Children; and there are no ſuch proper words uſed to diveſt it out of them, and to give it to the Survivors up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the deceaſe of any one of them under Age and Unmar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried. The Share or Part can only be the Thing it ſelf, not the Eſtate in the Thing; and 'tis all conſiſtent, if it be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged an Eſtate for Life.</p>
            <p>Beſides, In the laſt Clauſe, when he enjoyns the Heir to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the Deviſees to enjoy their Intereſts, and in caſe he do not diſcharge the Fee-farm Rent, he gives the reſt of his Shares to and amongſt all other of his Children and their Heirs, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually to be divided among them. The adding of the word <hi>Heirs</hi> in this Clauſe, and omitting it in the former, ſhews the
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:50172:112"/>Teſtator to have a different meaning in the firſt, from what he had in the laſt.</p>
            <p>Then were cited ſeveral Caſes to prove that <hi>totam illam partem</hi> carried only the Thing deviſed, not the Intereſt which the Devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor had therein, 3 <hi>Leon.</hi> 180, 181. 3 <hi>Cro.</hi> 52. 2 <hi>Leon.</hi> 156, 56. and 1 <hi>Rolls Abridg. tit. Eſtate,</hi> 835, 836. 1 <hi>Cro.</hi> 356. <hi>Latch.</hi> 40. and as to the 150 <hi>l.</hi> appointed to be paid for to bind <hi>Benjamin</hi> Apprentice, 'twas ſaid, That the ſame was to Iſſue out of the Rents and Profits. And therefore upon the whole, it was prayed, That the Judgment might be affirmed; and it was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed accordingly.</p>

               <pb n="215" facs="tcp:50172:114"/>
               <p>And now it was argued for the Plaintiffs in the Writ of Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror. That this Judgment was erroneous; and firſt it was anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Objection of the Variance between Knight and Eſq; and it was ſaid. That in caſe of a Title of Worſhip, the want of it could never viciate a Grant; that even in Indictments, upon the Statute of Additions, a Gentleman may be called Eſquire, and ſo <hi>e' contra,</hi> and thus is 2 <hi>Iuſt.</hi> that here <hi>conſtat de perſono,</hi> there's nothing doth appear to ſhew them to be different; that in caſe of Feoffments, this Pretence will not hurt, becauſe the Perſon is aſcertained, and here 'tis likewiſe the ſame, it is <hi>William Theck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ston</hi> then Eſq; and afterwards Knight, 'tis but one Man, they are two different Affirmations concerning the ſame Perſon; that in the Caſe cited on the other ſide of the Earl of <hi>Pembroke</hi> in <hi>Jones</hi>'s <hi>Rep.</hi> and in 1 <hi>Cro.</hi> 173. and <hi>Littlet.</hi> 191.223. <hi>Richardſon</hi> and <hi>Hutton</hi> are of Opinion, That ſuch Grant is good; then 'twas ſaid.

'Tis true, this is a Name or Title of Dignity to ſome purpoſes, but not to all: It muſt be agreed to be ſo upon Originals and Indictments, and there is a very good reaſon for it; becauſe in that Caſe a greater Certainty is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, that one Man may not ſuffer for or inſtead of another; but in Caſe of Grants, any Deſcription of the Perſon is ſufficient; beſides, if a Name be miſtaken in a Writ or Indictment, another may be ſued or preferred by the true Name, but a Man cannot of common Right demand a new Grant; tho' this be a Grant from the Crown, 'tis the ſame caſe, for the King's Grant ſhall be taken moſt beneficially for the Support of his Honour, 6 <hi>Rep.</hi> 6. that here's no COlour to pretend two <hi>William Theck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stons.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then it was ſaid, That this at moſt was only an Addition of Enlargement to his Name, not parcel of the Name it ſelf, for no more goes to that, than Chriſtian and Sirname; then 'twas ſaid, 'tis generally known, That the uſe of Sirname was not ſettled amongſt us, till long after the Conqueſt; that before then they were named by their Titles, Offices. Places of Birth or Reſidence, or Employments, as doth appear plainly by <hi>Dugdale</hi> 1. <hi>Monaſt.</hi> 37. In thoſe Days <hi>Miles</hi> was uſed inſtead of the Sir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>name, immediately after the Chriſtian Name, as <hi>Ego Wolwardus Miles,</hi> and many more ſuch. <hi>Selden's Tit. of Hon.</hi> 637, 638. thus in 1 <hi>Monaſt.</hi> 166. <hi>Domim Algari militis,</hi> 2 <hi>Monaſt.</hi> 173.853.
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:50172:115"/>thus it was in the time of <hi>Hen.</hi> 2. then after Sirnames came to be uſed, this Title of <hi>Miles</hi> was alſo uſed as an Addition or Inlargement after the Sirname; <hi>Cambden</hi>'s <hi>Treatiſe of Sirnames</hi> in his <hi>Remains,</hi> and <hi>Kennell's Parochial Antiquities,</hi> lately Printed at <hi>Oxford,</hi> in 4to. do ſhew this, That the Title of Knight came after the Sirname as an increaſe, not in Reu of it, as Merchant, Mercer, &amp;c. Profeſſor of Divinity, Law, Muſick, Maſter of Arts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for further Diſtinction ſake. Then it was ſaid, That this uſe of Sirnames holds not in caſe of Biſhops, Dukes or Earls, for they add only the Place, and therefore the Deſcent or Acceſſion of the Honour, comes inſtead of the Sirname, ſo is 2 <hi>Inſt.</hi> 666. but now <hi>William Theckston,</hi> when made a Knight, he remains <hi>William Theckston</hi> ſtill, he loſes no part of his former Name, tho' the ſame be inlarged; if it had been otherwiſe 'twould have merged the Sirname, but his Title makes no Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration therein at all: The Law doth require a Man to be named only by his Chriſtian and Sirname, unleſs ſomewhat comes in lieu of the laſt, or the firſt be altered by Confirmation; a Grant is good, if the Party be ſo deſcribed, as that he may be known, tho' there be a Miſtake in it, yet 'tis good, as a Grant to an Earl or Biſhop by a wrong Chriſtian Name, hath been held 2 <hi>Rolls Abr. Tit. Grants,</hi> 44. <hi>Dyer</hi> 376. 'tis the Identity of the Perſon, which the Law doth moſt regard and value; and therefore, ſince there was no preſence, but that the ſame Perſon who grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it to <hi>Pierſe,</hi> was intended by and in the King's Patent; it was hoped, That ſuch a Nicety ſhould not loſe the Subjects In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance in this Advowſon, which he had bought for a valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Conſideration: Further it was ſaid, this could not hurt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Oyer</hi> of this Grant in this Record, as this Caſe ſtood, and ſhould be further ſhewn anon.</p>
               <p>Then it was argued, That either take the Caſe upon the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration and Plea alone; or take it as it ſtands upon the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Patents alone; either of theſe two ways, 'tis with the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject: If the Patent be conſidered by it ſelf, there's nothing ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to make it void, the King had a Power to grant, and there are Words ſufficient to paſs it. Then conſider the Declaration and Plea, there's a good barr to the Title laid in the Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; ſo that the only Objection can be upon the Rules of plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as it ſtands all together; and the Query is, If <hi>P.</hi> hath own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or confeſs'd any ſuch thing as is pretended of a Seiſin in groſs, in <hi>Eliz. anno</hi> 12. and if it be admitted, whether the King can take an Advantage of the Variance between the Patent ſet forth on <hi>Oyer,</hi> and that which is pleaded, the ſame being only pleaded by way of Inducement, whether the King can waive his own Title, and queſtion the Defendants in this Caſe.</p>
               <p>As to the firſt, it was ſaid, That this Grant was not void by reaſon of any ſuch Admiſſion, the King declared his full Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, That Sir <hi>William</hi> ſhould fully and freely enjoy this Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowſon,
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:50172:115"/>any Defects to the contrary notwithſtanding; that 'tis not admitted in this Caſe to have been an Advowſon in groſs, in the 12th of Q. <hi>Eliz.</hi> no ſuch thing doth appear; and then the Grant of <hi>Car.</hi> 1. is good; and if it did ſo appear, yet the Grant is good. The Plea doth ſay, that <hi>Car.</hi> 1. came to it by Deſcent, but that doth not admit her ſeized in groſs: That Allegation in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration is mear Surpluſage and Immaterial, and cannot hurt the Party which makes it, tho' contradictory to, or inconſiſtent with his Title: Nor can it benefit the other ſide to deny it; for if he had denied it, it could have done him no good; and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to admit it, ſhall not hurt him. Now 'tis not neceſſary in a <hi>Quare Impedit</hi> to alledge a time of Seiſin; a Seiſin generally in time of Peace is enough; then the not denying, admits only what is materially alledged. Suppoſe the Defendant had pleaded <hi>abſque hoc,</hi> that Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> did preſent <hi>Tymmes modo et for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma;</hi> and it had appeared upon the Trial, that he was preſented in the 43d Year of her Reign, it muſt have been againſt the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant. Even, where time is required to be alledged, another time may be proved, as in Treſpaſs, Battery, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The moſt that can be pretended to, is, that here is an Admiſſion of her being ſeized in groſs after the Grant to the Earl; and it might be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant then, and afterwards got to the Crown by Preſentations; there's no colour to ſuppoſe an admiſſion of the time. <hi>Hob.</hi> 71. The Caſe of <hi>Sherly</hi> and <hi>Wood,</hi> and 2 <hi>Leon.</hi> 99. prove that neither alledging or confeſſing a thing immaterial ſhall hurt; the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is the ſame for both.</p>
               <p>There was a plain Artifice in this Pleading; the Declaration men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions a Preſentation, <hi>prout per</hi> Inrolment, which cannot be, unleſs in the ſame Court; otherwiſe you muſt plead an Exemplification, <hi>Wymock</hi>'s Caſe, 5 <hi>Rep.</hi> If the Declaration had been in the common uſual way, ſetting out the Queen to have been ſeized generally, or to have preſented generally, there had nothing appeared to have hurt this Grant; for it might then have been appendant; and if it might be ſo, it ſhall be intended to be ſo; for he is not bound to aver it to be appendant; for upon <hi>Oyer</hi> every thing ſhall be intended to make a Grant good, unleſs the contrary doth appear, 2 <hi>Cro.</hi> 679. he need not plead, that it was appendant at the time of the Grant to the Earl; <hi>Conceſſit</hi> is enough, and that tho' in general words, 35 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. <hi>Bro. Pleading</hi> 143. <hi>Kelway</hi> 43. 1 <hi>Rolls Abridg.</hi> 405.</p>
               <p>Then ſuppoſe it did appear that this Advowſon was not appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant in the 13th <hi>Eliz.</hi> yet it doth paſs: There is but one ſuppoſed Falſity, and that is Dr. <hi>Wilſon</hi>'s Preſentation by Lapſe, which is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to be <hi>pleno jure;</hi> Firſt, The Grant is full, expreſs, and large e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, <hi>Know ye therefore,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>All our Right,</hi> &amp;c. as full words as can be uſed, without any reſtriction whatſoever. And as to the Suggeſtions, there's not any Miſtake in them: 'Tis not ſuggeſted that 'twas ever appendant; not ſuggeſted that it did paſs by thoſe Letters Patents; nor that it came to <hi>Th.</hi> but only that he claimed it; and the word <hi>claim</hi> doth not always import a lawful Claim;
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:50172:116"/>for a Man is amerciable <hi>pro falſo clamore:</hi> Here's as much Caution and Care in the penning of theſe Letters Patents as was poſſible, nothing but what is exact.</p>
               <p>Suppoſe a Man doth claim an Advowſon by a void Grant, and he brings a Writ, after the King hath preſented; and the King ſays, <hi>Let my Clerk have it quietly for his Life, and you ſhall have a Grant from me, and ſhall be ſecure of all my Right for the future:</hi> 'tis not ſaid, that 'twas Sir <hi>William</hi>'s Preſentation, but he ſued a Writ ſo deſcribing it.</p>
               <p>'Tis admitted by <hi>Car.</hi> 1. that this Patent might be void, yet it was his Intention that <hi>Th.</hi> ſhould have it for the future: This In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent is as plain as words can make it; that he and his Heirs ſhould for ever enjoy it, notwithſtanding any defect in the Patent of Q. <hi>Eliz.</hi> 'Tis not only to reſtore an old Title, and make reparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for the wrong done by the King's Preſentation, but in Caſe the old Title were defective, to make and give to him a good one: If it appears that the King's Intention were for paſſing it, it ſhall paſs, notwithſtanding a Miſ-recital.</p>
               <p>Suppoſe the Grant had been recited at large, and no more had been ſaid but the King confirms it, would not that have been good: Then was cited the Earl of <hi>Cumberland</hi>'s Caſe, 8 <hi>Rep.</hi> 166. the word therefore is in that Caſe too; yet becauſe full words are ſuperad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, it ſhall not be qualified by the Deed recited, and that is a much ſtronger Caſe than this: <hi>Hill.</hi> 22 <hi>&amp;</hi> 23 <hi>Car.</hi> 2. Sir <hi>Robert At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins</hi> verſus <hi>Holton,</hi> 'tis <hi>in Ventris.</hi> And the pleading in <hi>Vidian</hi>'s <hi>Ent'.</hi> agreed that King <hi>John</hi>'s Patent was void, and King <hi>Edw.</hi> muſt have been deceived in his Grant, and his Intention might be there ſaid to be only to make a Reſtitution. And a falſe Inquifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion turns a Man as much out of poſſeſſion of a Franchiſe, as the King's Preſentation doth out of a Patronage; but held there, that tho' King <hi>John</hi>'s Grant was void, yet that of <hi>Edward</hi> was good, becauſe the words were full and General, and the King ſhewed his intent that the Party ſhould have the thing. But the other ſide have objected, That this is a qualified Intention according to the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of the firſt Patent. To which it was anſwered, That the King did ſuppoſe that Patent to be defective, and his true intent was that <hi>Th.</hi> ſhould have the Advowſon. Beſides, tho' it were in groſs, yet it might have the reputation of being appendant, and it was the King's meaning to paſs it, 6 <hi>Rep.</hi> 63. a ſmall matter will make a reputation of an Appendancy. If a Man mortgages his Mannor, excepting the Advowſon thereto belonging, 'tis become in groſs; but when the Condition is performed, and the Deed avoided, 'tis appendant again; therefore it might be thought appendant; it might be ſome accident, which did ſever it from the Mannor; yet if it had the reputation of being ſo, it might be within the King's intent to paſs it, tho' it did not paſs by the firſt; 'twas intended that ſome Advowſon ſhould paſs, and here are expreſs words to paſs this: In <hi>Coke</hi>'s <hi>Entries... Quare Impedit,</hi> it appears that this Advowſon of <hi>Bedall</hi> was appendant.</p>
               <p>It further appears by Hiſtory, That this <hi>Simon Digby</hi> had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:50172:116"/>Treaſon, before the Church was void; and before Attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Queen preſented, that made it in groſs, then the Attainder makes it appendant again; then tho' it might be poſſible that the Queen was ſeized in groſs, yet if it were ſo, upon <hi>Digby</hi>'s Attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſhe was ſeized of it as appendant: now if any thing might make it appendant, 'twill be hard to conſtrue it void, where, for any thing that doth appear, it might be good. Such Declarations ſo ſubtle may enſnare any Defendant, and take away any Man's Inheritance. The Attorney ſhould have taken Iſſue upon the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, and that would have brought the whole Matter in queſtion.</p>
               <p>As to the miſtake about <hi>Wilſon</hi>'s Preſentation, that cannot vitiate againſt an expreſs intent; the King's deſign was to determine the difference between his Incumbent and another; he would not have his Right in this Benefice to be queſtioned or diſputed; for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, there was no reaſon for <hi>Th.</hi> to take a Grant to avoid Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie, and yet that new Grant to leave him in as bad or worſe Condition; here's both Confirmation and Grant; and if ſo, what matters it, whether <hi>Wilſon</hi> were preſented one way or the other. <hi>Th.</hi> could not have been in a worſe Condition, if he had miſcarried in his Writ, the King deſigned to him all the Right which he had, and otherwiſe he was at the charge of procuring Letters Patents, to no other purpoſe then to be deceived. Beſides, here was a good Conſideration, tho' <hi>Th.</hi> had no right: a Surrender of void Letters Patents is a good Conſideration: 1 <hi>Rep.</hi> 143. <hi>Altonwood</hi>'s Caſe, and 5 <hi>Rep.</hi> 65. Lord <hi>Chandois</hi>'s Caſe; the King there thought himſelf ſeized by virtue of the Surrender, which he was not, yet held good; ſo that 'tis not every Miſtake that will avoid a Grant, when the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention appears, 1 <hi>Rolls Rep.</hi> 23. Therefore if there may be any thing given in Evidence, which might ſupport theſe Letters Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, they ſhall not be adjudged void upon <hi>Oyer:</hi> and to make theſe void of <hi>Car.</hi> 1. they muſt conſtrue thoſe of the Queen void; and theſe cannot be adjudged void, becauſe they are not before the Court; Letters Patents recited were never adjudged illegal; for notwithſtanding this recital, there might be more words in them, which might make them good: 'tis <hi>inter alia,</hi> ſuppoſe it had been <hi>ſpectant'</hi> or <hi>exiſtent'</hi> in <hi>Bedall,</hi> that would have paſſed the Advow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in groſs: 'Tis not inconſiſtent with any thing ſaid in this Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of <hi>Car.</hi> 1. to ſay that the other of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> contained or paſſed more, <hi>Mod. Rep.</hi> 194, 195. <hi>Hardres</hi> 231. the <hi>igitur</hi> is only <hi>nota continuationis,</hi> and doth not always ſuppoſe all that's prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to be the Conſideration, it can't well begin a Deed, and that is all: 'tis <hi>Exuberiori gratia,</hi> &amp;c. 3 <hi>Leon.</hi> 249. 'Tis impoſſible to ſuppoſe or uſe more comprehenſive words then in this Caſe, and therefore it was inferred that theſe Letters Patents of <hi>Car.</hi> 1. were good.</p>
               <p>Then it was argued further with the Plaintiff in the Writ of Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, that in this Caſe Mr. <hi>Attorney</hi> can take no advantage of either of theſe Miſtakes in the Defendant's Plea, if they are ſuch; for that 'tis only Matter of Inducement; and the Letters Patents needed not have been pleaded with a <hi>profert hic in curia,</hi> and therefore cannot hurt; If the Inducement be good to maintain the Traverſe
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:50172:117"/>or make it material, that's enough; but ſtill the Inducement is not traverſable: 'Tis true, that generally ſpeaking, a Deed or Grant after <hi>Oyer</hi> becomes part of the Plea, but ſtill 'tis only Inducement. If a Defendant confeſſes and avoids, the Plaintiff ſhall not depend upon that which he confeſſes, but anſwer that whereby he avoids the Plaintiffs Title or Charge: This is no more then if they had traverſed the Grant, which they could not do. In the Caſe of a common Perſon, ſuppoſe the Defendant's Title not full, yet if he traverſes the Plaintiffs, that's enough: Form requires an Induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to a Traverſe, but the latter is only material for the Plaintiff to anſwer to; for nothing can be traverſed, but what is material; now why ſhould it not have been a good anſwer to their Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to have ſaid that <hi>Car.</hi> 2. preſented by Lapſe, <hi>abſque hoc</hi> that <hi>Car.</hi> 1. died ſeized; for by this the Seiſin or Preſentation of <hi>Car.</hi> 2. had been avoided; and there's nothing elſe material in the Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; for the Seiſin of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> and <hi>Jac.</hi> 1. are not to the purpoſe; and if anſwered by the Defendant, it muſt have been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, there had been a good Title for the King without it: then ſuppoſing it neceſſary to ſhew how it came out of <hi>Car.</hi> 1. the Attorney General can only take Iſſue on the Traverſe of his dying ſeized; for that denies the whole Title that is material to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered to: Now whatſoever ſhews that the Plaintiff hath no right to the thing in demand, is a good Plea, let who will have the true right: The true Title upon this Declaration is that <hi>Car.</hi> 1. pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, and thereby became ſeized, and died ſeized; and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying him to dye ſeized, is a denial of this Title; for if K. <hi>Car.</hi> 2. did preſent by Lapſe, and K. <hi>Car.</hi> 1. did not die ſeized, 'tis with the Defendant; no Man is bound to anſwer that, which if he do, 'twill ſtill be againſt him; but if a Man makes ſuch an anſwer, as if true, the preſent Plaintiff hath no Title, 'tis enough: Then if it be true that no Right deſcended from <hi>Car.</hi> 1. to <hi>Car.</hi> 2. and that <hi>Car.</hi> 2. pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented only by Lapſe, what Right can his preſent Majeſty have: and all this is confeſſed by the Demurrer, if well pleaded; and 'tis no Objection to ſay, that the dying ſeized ought not to be tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed, but only the Preſentation; for that is a miſtake; in caſe of Land 'tis good; and an Advowſon is an Inheritance deſcendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in like manner, and Mr. Attorney thinks it a good Traverſe; for he all along in his Declaration, alledges a dying feized from Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> downward: and there are ſeveral Preſidents thus, <hi>Winch</hi>'s <hi>Ent.</hi> 661, 662. and <hi>Winch.</hi> 912, 686, 692. and <hi>Buckler</hi> and <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds, Winch.</hi> 911, 912. is of an Advowſon in groſs; and in the ſame Book 35, 59, are thus: A man may die ſeized of an Advow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as well as of Land; and if he doth not dye ſeized, it doth not deſcend; and the Seiſin in groſs is not to be traverſed, as is 1 <hi>Anderſon</hi> 269. and <hi>Hob.</hi> 102.</p>
               <p>'Then 'twas ſaid that the true Reaſon and Nature of a material good Traverſe is well explained in <hi>Vaughan</hi>'s firſt Caſe of <hi>Tufton</hi> and Sir <hi>Rich. Temple,</hi> and 1 <hi>Saund.</hi> 21, 22. and it is this, eſpecially in a <hi>Quare Impedit,</hi> If any thing in the Count be travers'd, it muſt be ſuch Part, as if true, is inconſiſtent with the Defendants Title,
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:50172:117"/>and if falſe or found againſt the Plaintiff, doth abſolutely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy his Title; nay, if the Traverſe leaves no Title in the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff, then 'tis good, whatſoever comes of the Defendants. Then the Difficulty is, If the King by his Prerogative may waive his own Title which is traverſed, and inſiſt upon the Deficiency of that which the Defendant alledges; and in the Caſe of the King and the Biſhop of <hi>Worceſter,</hi> and <hi>Jervis,</hi> in <hi>Vaughan</hi> 53. there 'tis ſaid, That the King ought to maintain his own, and not to queſtion the Defendants; he cannot deſert that which he hath alledged for himſelf, and fall upon the Defendants Title; and Reaſon warrants ſuch Rule for (tho' the King hath no Damages in a <hi>Quare Impedit</hi> notwithſtanding his laying it <hi>ad dampnum, Hob.</hi> 23, yet) the Suit ſuppoſes an Hindrance and Damage to the King, and if the Right be not his, he hath no Cauſe to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of the Defendant, tho' another hath: Every Man is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover by his own Strength, and not by the Weakneſs of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendants Pretenſions; and if the Law be thus, then how can Mr. Attorney-General take Advantage of this upon Demurrer after <hi>Oyer,</hi> for now upon <hi>Oyer</hi> 'tis, as they ſay, become Part of the Defendants Plea, and conſequently it muſt be part of the Induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and if ſo, he ought in that Caſe, to have taken Iſſue up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Traverſe, which denied his Maſter's Title: Wherefore, upon the whole Matter, it was prayed, That the Judgment ſhould be reverſed.</p>
               <p>On the other ſide, 'twas argued for the King, That this Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ought to ſtand, and as to the laſt point, 'twas ſaid, That taking it for granted, the King could not traverſe any Point of the Defendants Plea; yet certainly he might demurr upon the whole, in caſe it were inſufficient; That now <hi>Oyer</hi> was craved, and had, the Deed did become part of the Defendants Plea, and muſt be taken as ſuch; That tho' there had been no need of a <hi>Profert,</hi> yet when 'tis produced, 'tis ſuch as he hath pleaded, and upon the whole, the Court is to judge, there being a Demurrer; That as the Caſe ſtood, the King might take advantage of both the Exceptions; That the Declaration of it ſelf was good, and if the Plea be naught, the King ought to have Judgment for him; That every Plea is to be taken moſt ſtrongly againſt the Party that pleads it; That here the Defendant had admitted K. <hi>Car.</hi> 1. well ſeized, that he ought to ſhew it out of him, otherwiſe the Plea was ill, that every Traverſe muſt have an Inducement; That if upon the whole Plea, it did not appear that King <hi>Car.</hi> 1. parted with this Advowſon, 'tis naught; That if by the Parties own ſhewing, it was manifeſt to the Court, That the King con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſeized, and what he doth further ſhew, no ways contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts it, he could not traverſe the dying ſeized, and therefore a Demurrer was moſt proper; and conſequently, upon this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murrer, they were let in to affirm, that nothing paſſed from the King by theſe Letters Patents of <hi>Car.</hi> 1.</p>
               <p>Then it was argued, That this Grant was void, becauſe it was to a Perſon then Eſq; that <hi>Tunc Armigero,</hi> can have Reference
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:50172:118"/>only to the time of the Letters Patents, that a Man cannot be a Knight and an Eſq; at the ſame time, that Knight is part of his Name, and the Title of Eſq; is drowned in that of Knight, that the old Books are thus, 7 <hi>Hen.</hi> 4.7. 14 <hi>Hen.</hi> 6.15. 21 <hi>Edw.</hi> 4.72. 2 <hi>Inst.</hi> 594. 666. <hi>Hutt.</hi> 41. <hi>Bro. Tit. noſme.</hi> 33. 1 <hi>Cro.</hi> 372. That 'tis true, if a Deed of Feoffment be made to a Man by a wrong Name, and Livery be thereupon had, 'tis good; but all the Books make a difference between that Caſe, and where it is by Deed, where the Operation is altogether by Deed: Then was cited the Earl of <hi>Pembroke</hi>'s Caſe, in <hi>Littleton</hi>'s <hi>Rep.</hi> 181. and in <hi>Jones,</hi> 215, 223. the Court went upon the Reaſon, that the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry found him to be the ſame Perſon, <hi>Latch.</hi> 161. there they would intend him an Eſq; at the time of the Commiſſion, and a Knight at the time of the Return, and it was for Neceſſity-ſake, for to prevent the avoiding of ſo many Trials, as had been upon that Commiſſion.</p>
               <p>Lord <hi>Ewre</hi>'s Caſe, 2 <hi>Cro.</hi> 240. there 'twas held well enough, becauſe ſufficiently deſcribed; ſo in a Grant, if it cannot be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended otherwiſe than to the ſame Perſon, there 'tis well enough; but here they can never be the ſame: In Caſe of an Earl or Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, there 'tis underſtood, who is meant by the Deſcription, there can be but one of that Title; but here the Plea ſaith, That he was not a Knight at the time; and Sir <hi>Thomas Ormond</hi> was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainted by the Name of <hi>Thomas Ormond,</hi> Eſq; and ill for that Reaſon, 2 <hi>Rolls Abr.</hi> 43.198. <hi>Dyer</hi> 150.1 <hi>Leon.</hi> 159.160. the higheſt and loweſt Dignity are univerſal, and the ſame in every Kingdom, 7 <hi>Rep.</hi> 16.20. <hi>Edw.</hi> 4.6. can any body ſay upon this Grant, That the King intended to paſs this Advowſon to a Man, that then was only an Eſq; <hi>Selden.</hi> 682. the Addition of Eſq; is drowned and merged in that of Knight, and <hi>Selden</hi> was a very competent and good Judge of this Matter: Then 'twas ſaid, that the only way to ſalve this, which had not been urged for the Plaintiff, was, that he might be reputed a Knight, and a Name of Reputation will be ſufficient to take by, and to this it was anſwered, That he who is reputed a Knight, and is none, cannot take by that Name: And beſides, if he could, it ſhould have been plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a <hi>per Nomen;</hi> in caſe of a Baſtard, the Reputative Name muſt be ſhewn to make the Grant good; the Degree of Knight was formerly of Eſteem in the Law, as upon a Writ of Right, if the Miſe be joyned; and if a Peer be Party to any Iſſue at Law, triable by Jury, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As to the Objection, that a Grant to one by a Name of Dignity, which he really had not, <hi>viz.</hi> The El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt Son of a Duke as a Marqueſs, and that a Grant to him by that Name is good, 'twas anſwered, That there was a real Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, he takes place after all, real Marqueſſes as a Marqueſs by the Rules of Heraldry: There's a ground for it, from the Precedency given him by the common Uſe and Cuſtom of the Realm, and they are named ſo now-a-days in Deeds, but ancient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Conveyancers were more Cautinos, and named them Eſquires commonly called Marqueſſes; and even now, careful Men call
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:50172:118"/>them eldeſt Sons of ſuch Dukes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If a Reputation would have done it, the pleading ſhould have been with a <hi>Cognit' et Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putat' per Nomen:</hi> It is the name which intitles the Grantees to take, and otherwiſe they have no pretence to claim by ſuch Letters Patents, no more than <hi>John</hi> or <hi>Thomas Theckston;</hi> and if the Perſon hath any other Name of Reputation, that ought to be ſhewn, wherefore it was hoped, That this was cauſe enough to affirm the Judgment.</p>
               <p>Then it was argued, That this Grant was void as a Grant of an Advowſon appendant, when upon the Record, it appeared to be an Advowſon in groſs; that the Defendant had admitted it an Advowſon in groſs, in Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> that he hath not only admitted, but confeſs'd it in almoſt direct terms, by ſaying, <hi>Bene &amp; Verum eſt,</hi> that <hi>Car.</hi> 1. became and was ſeized in manner as in the Declaration; this is a full Confeſſion, That the Queen was ſeized in groſs, 'twas ſaid to come to that King by Deſcent, and ſo there is no room left for Preſumption or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendment, that it was by any wrongful or other Seiſin. Then 'twas urged, That nothing paſſed to the Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi> becauſe not appendant, but in groſs, and for this was cited <hi>Moor</hi> 45. <hi>Hob.</hi> 322, 323. and other Books; ſo that it doth not appear, that the King did intend to paſs this Advowſon; for in the Grant to the Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi> there's no Grant of it by any expreſs Name, which its probable would have been, had the ſame been intended; now to ſuppoſe it appendant, is to ſuppoſe againſt the Record, againſt both the Averment in the Count, and the Confeſſion in the Plea, 'tis in general Words, <hi>una cum Advoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionibus,</hi> &amp;c. nor does it paſs by the Letters Patents of <hi>Car.</hi> 1. becauſe it did not paſs to the Earl, by thoſe of Queen <hi>Eliz.</hi> this Grant is uſhered in after all the Recitals, and thoſe ſuppoſe the Advowſon to have paſſed by the firſt; <hi>Igitur;</hi> wherefore, it muſt be upon Conſideration of what is before alledged, this is at leaſt an illative Word, and cannot begin an independent Subſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Clauſe of it ſelf; ſo is <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lterius,</hi> 2 <hi>Browt.</hi> 132. If this Granting Part ſhould be taken to be Subſtantive, and to have no Reference to what is precedent, all thoſe Recitals would be vain and inſignificant, and the King might as well have begun with the Words of the Grant. The King's Grants are to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken according to his Intentions, and thoſe are to be expounded by the Recitals; then were quoted many Caſes, as 5 <hi>Rep.</hi> 93. <hi>Hob.</hi> 120.203. <hi>Hutt.</hi> 7.2 <hi>Rolls Abr.</hi> 189.11 <hi>Rep.</hi> 93. and it was ſaid, That here are many falſe Recitals, Sir <hi>Will, Theckston</hi> claims, that muſt be intended a lawful Claim, whereas he could not lawfully challenge any Right to this Advowſon; That the King preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Wilſon</hi> by lapſe; The King was deceived in thinking that this paſſed to the Earl; The Agreement between Dr. <hi>Wickham</hi> and Sir <hi>William Theckston,</hi> was only to deceive the King: Here's no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice taken of the Advowſons being in groſs; The Quality and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Advowſon is totally concealed from the King; the Words notwithſtanding any Defect, helps only want of Form;
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:50172:119"/>Here was a plain Artifice in the Matter; in Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Grant, it was Advowſons in General, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but when <hi>Car.</hi> 1. is to confirm that Grant, 'tis of that Church by Name; all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termediate Recitals between that of the firſt Grant, and the words of this new Grant, are dependent on that firſt: The King's In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, That <hi>Theckston</hi> ſhould have it, is not abſolutely, but <hi>ſecund' Thenorem &amp; Intentionem</hi> of the former Patent; the King meant only to reſtore to him his old Right which he had by that Patent, notwithſtanding the Preſentations, 10 <hi>Rep.</hi> 110. all Facts recited in the King's Grant, ſhall be intended to be of the Suggeſtion of the Patentee. If there be ſeveral Conſiderations, and one falſe, and the King deceived thereby, it ſhall viciate the Grant, 3 <hi>Leon.</hi> 249. <hi>Voers</hi> Caſe cited in <hi>Legates</hi> Caſe; <hi>Fits. Tit. Grant,</hi> 58. 3 <hi>Leon.</hi> 119. If the Granting Words had ſtood alone, the Caſe had been more doubtful, but here they are all coupled. In all the King's Grants, there muſt be ſome Conſiderations for his Favour, and abundance of Caſes were quoted concerning the King's Grants, Miſrecitals, falſe Recitals, and Deceit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Then it was ſtrenuouſly inſiſted upon, That the Recitals and the Granting Clauſe, muſt be conſider'd and judged of together; that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Opinion, is to make the Granting Part to be without any Conſideration; 'tis to have a Concluſion without Premiſſes, <hi>an igitur</hi> without a Cauſe; That <hi>eadem ſervitia</hi> can never be intended new ones; That <hi>ſecundum tenorem</hi> muſt referr to the Appendant Advowſon, and therefore the Advowſon in groſs here declared upon and pleaded to, can never paſs by this Grant, and upon the whole it was prayed, That the Judgment might be affirmed.</p>
               <p>It was replied on behalf of the Plaintiff in Error, That as to the Variance in the Title of Knight, no Anſwer had been given to the reaſonable Diſtinction between the Caſe of Grants, and that of Writs and Indictments, that here was no Proof or Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of a Diverſity of Perſons; That as to the Grant it ſelf, <hi>ſecund' tenorem,</hi> could mean only a Reference to the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt or Eſtate granted by them, not to the thing or the Nature of it; That ſuch Words ſignified only, as fully and largely, they had no expreſs Relation to the Quality of the Advowſon, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in groſs or appendant; That by ſuch Niceties, any or moſt Patents might be avoided, That Grants of Honours as well as of Intereſts, if queſtioned, muſt be under the ſame Rule; and the Conſiderations upon which they are grounded, may be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to Inquiry, if true or falſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That the Patent of it ſelf, without Reference to the pleading was good, That the Judgment deſired, was to condemn a Patent as void, becauſe another Patent recited in it was ſo, which perhaps was not fully recited; and if it were, was not in Judgment before the Court; and the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of what was urged before, was in ſhort repeated, and prayed, That the Judgment might be revers'd, and it was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly revers'd; and Mr. <hi>Pierſe</hi> (<hi>Scroope</hi> being dead) pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented <hi>Francis Pemberton</hi> his Clerk, who was admitted, inſtituted and inducted, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
